rsc62224	odour		sulphureous		But although bitumen cannot at present be artificially formed from the resinous and other vegetable substances by any of the known chemical processes , yet there is every reason to believe , that the agent employed by nature in the formation of coal and bitumen has been either muriatic or sulphuric acid ; and when it is considered , that common salt is never found in coal mines except when in the vicinity of salt springs , whilst on the contrary , pyrites , sulphate of iron , and alum , most commonly are present ; * these facts , together with the sulphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral coals when burned , appear strongly to evince the agency of the latter .

rsc6170	effluvium		usual		lost a portion of its natural electricity , and became thereby electrified negatively : the following facts seem to substantiate this suppositione The room I usually inhabit being of small dimensions , is on that account more liable to suIaer a change in the electrical state of its air than a larger one , and having been often struck with the constancy of the doubler charging llegatively in it , whereas in the open air , and often in the adjoining room , which is larger , the doubler would give positive electricity ; I saw nothing to occasion this difference between the two rooms besides what could be attributed to the respiration and to the usual effluvium of my body .
rsc6170	exhalation		noxious|offensive		I has observed before , that the air in the garret was infected with a noxious exhalation , hich I now judge came from the tearing apparel laid up in it : whereas the air in the kitchens was not only much cooler , but perfectly clear of all offensive exlzlalations .

rsc610030	emanation		radium		The rest of this paper deals with the behaviour of the active deposit inside sealed tubes containing radium emanation .
rsc610030	emanation	radium			A series * of experiments on the activity of the radium emanation at high temperatures , made in the beginning of the investigation , will now be described .
rsc610030	emanation	radium|radium C			Makower , } working with radium emanation inside tubes of sealed quartz , found , however , that the / 3 - radiation from radium C was reduced in intensity from 4 to 15 per cent , by heating the tube to temperatures over 1000 ' , the measurements being conducted in the cold .
rsc610030	emanation		distinctly		In later experiments with RussS the same author found that , while the / 3 - activity of the emanation was distinctly lower at high temperatures than at room temperature , it decayed at 1100 ' at the normal rate .
rsc610030	emanation	deposit			Engler , | | working on the same lines as Makower and Russ , measured the / 3 - activity both of the emanation and of the active deposit during heating and cooling , as well as when a steady temperature had been reached .
rsc610030	emanation|emanation		liberated		( b ) On cooling , the products , all except the emanation , are suddenly absorbed again by the preparation , with a consequent sudden return of the / 3 - radiation to its initial value , ( c ) Three hours afterwards a new set of products is produced on the walls of the containing tube from the liberated emanation , which causes the ^ - radiation gradually to return to the higher value .
rsc610030	emanation|emanation		liberated|fresh		( d ) Then over a period of three weeks the liberated emanation decays , while fresh emanation is produced within the solid preparation , producing a gradual decay of the / 3 - rays to their initial value .

rsc615999	emanation				Since the wires , r and W , had been exposed to the same emanation for the same time and removed from its influence simultaneously , the activity of both decayed at the same rate .
rsc615999	emanation|emanation				Prom the results obtained it seemed probable that this change was not due to any alteration of the emanation itself , but rather to a change of activity of one of the more quickly decaying products of the emanation with which it is in equilibrium .
rsc615999	emanation|emanation	radium			( 1 ) The change in activity noticed when radium emanation is subjected to a high temperature is not due to any alteration in the emanation itself , since its time period is unaltered when it is maintained at a temperature of 1100 ' .
rsc615999	emanation	radium			, and he also concludes that the change in the activity obtained when radium emanation is heated in a quartz tube and allowed to cool is only apparent ; the effect observed he ascribes to a preferential condensation of the active deposit at the ends of the tube used when the latter is removed from the furnace .
rsc615999	emanation	radium			Bronson heated radium itself , whereas we heated the active deposit when separated from radium and the emanation .
rsc615999	emanation	from about 5 milligrammes of radium bromide			A small quartz tube was filled with the emanation from about 5 milligrammes of radium bromide , and then sealed off in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe .
rsc615999	emanation|emanation				Since the rate of decay of the emanation is unaltered by high temperature , the change of activity observed when the emanation is heated must be due to some alteration in one of the more rapidly decaying products \ # 151 ; A , B , or C .
rsc615999	emanation|emanation	a considerable|of radium			The experiment consisted in collecting on two wires the active deposit from a considerable quantity of radium emanation by immersing the wires simultaneously in the emanation contained in a cylindrical vessel for three or four hours , the wires being situated along the axis of the cylinder .
rsc615999	emanation	radium			In a previous paper * it has been shown that the activity of radium emanation sealed in a quartz tube is temporarily changed by subjecting it for a short time to temperatures between 1000 ' C .

rsc63578	smell	of excrement	flabby|very offensive|fatty		On the fourth it had the smell of excrement , was flabby , very offensive , and fatty upon the surface .
rsc63578	smell		peculiar|so different from		We learn also , that this change is produced just as putrefaction is beginning to take place , and if the substance goes rapidly into putrefaction , no fat is formed , and , what is deserving of observation , the peculiar smell belonging to faces , so different from that of putrid matter , is produced at the time that fat is procured .
rsc63578	smell				The process which the contents of the colon undergo , is quite distinct from any thing carried on in the other intestines , since they entirely change their appearance and smell ; and there is commonly a valve to prevent any part of them , even the gases evolved , from being carried up into the small intestines .
rsc63578	smell	of the feces	peculiar		The peculiar smell of the feces , which borders so closely on that from putrefaction , although by no means the same , led me to compare them with the animal matter buried in the earth , which is converted into adipocere : in both cases the substance is in the incipient state of putrefaction , but that process never completely takes place ; it is excluded from the external air , is either under water , or within the reach of imbibing moisture ; and there is no substance whatever , the chyle MDcccXIII .

rsc63947	smell|effluvia	something	putrid		It is evident from hence , that something had escaped from the flesh , whilst yet void of any putrid smell , so as to render the air very noxious : I suppose this effluvia to be pure phlogiston .

rsc63947	smell		putrid		Hence it seems , that this principle is capable of rising , per se , uncombined with the saline part of animal bodies , the union of which is supposed to give the putrid smell .
rsc63947	smell	phlogiston			It proves Sir JOHN PRINGLE ' S supposition , that phlogiston , when single , is imperceptible to the smell ; but I think it also shows it to be pestilential .
rsc63947	smell|effluvia		putrid		In our experiments it was devoid of smell , consequently contained no mixture of volatilized acid ; yet it had the common property of all putrid effluvia , that of rendering common air noxious .
rsc63947	effluvia	vegetable			The following experiments were made to discover the effects of vegetable effluvia upon air .
rsc63947	effluvia	rotten vegetables|of rotten vegetable matters			For want of attention to this laborious but sole method of coming at truth , it is a pretty general opinion in the world , that even rotten vegetables are little noxious : and a late author , whom I only mention because his book is pretty generally read , in a chapter upon putrid fevers and infection , expressly says : ` ` The effluvia of rotten vegetable matters have little effect in contaminating the air ; from some experiments it appears , that they possess rather an antiseptic virtue .
rsc63947	effluvia		different		But in order to form a just idea of this , it seemed to me necessary to find , by exact experiments , the real effects of the different kinds of effluvia upon air , especially such as are in a natural state constantly mixing with the atmosphere , and to the effects of which all respiring animals are constantly exposed ; such are those from animal and vegetable substances , and from different kinds of soils .
rsc63947	smell		cadaverous		Instinct leads us to fly from the danger when we perceive the cadaverous smell .
rsc63947	smells		disagreeable		Hence I do not hesitate to declare , that in jails , hospitals , and other crowded places , we ought not by any means to estimate their wholesomeness by the absence of disagreeable smells alone .
rsc63947	effluvia		animal		Such was the effects of animal effluvia in a close and unventilated place in the space of eleven hours , that , out of one hundred and forty - six souls , no more than twenty - three came out alive , and those in a high , putrid fever , of which , however , by fresh air , & amp ; c .
rsc63947	smell		dirtyness|disagreeable		In hospitals , though the wards may give no marks of it by any apparent dirtyness or disagreeable smell , we may observe its effects ; diseases which usually admit in private practice of an easy cure , are often very tedious , and apt to assume anomalous symptoms .
rsc63947	effluvia|those	vegetables|substances			We have demonstrated , that the effluvia of vegetables , even whilst perfectly sweet and fresh , are equally poisonous with those from animal substances .
rsc63947	effluvia	fruit			Being desirous of finding the effects of effluvia from ripe fruit upon air , six ripe gooseberries sliced were enclosed sixteen hours in a phial with eight ounces of common air : the air being then put to the test , was found to be diminished from 62 ~ to 40 ~ .

rsc63947	odour	The volatile salt	volatile		The volatile salt was an example of the volatile odour .
rsc63947	odour		pure		Hence we find , that pure odour has little , if any , effect in polluting the air .
rsc63947	odour				Nor did I think it necessary to repeat the trials , being satisfied that their poisonous effects in the twelfth and thirteenth experiments were not in the least owing to their odour , but to their organized structure , tending to dissolution from the time they are deprived of nourishment ; such is the perfect agreement between vegetable and animal substances .
rsc63947	effluvia	bunches of flowers	of so noxious a nature		It is demonstrable from hence , that the filling of rooms with nose - gays and bunches of flowers is by no means a safe practice , especially in close rooms or sick chambers ; their effluvia are of so noxious a nature as quickly to render the air unfit for the purposes of respiration , and cannot fail of having bad effects upon sick and valetudinary people in particular .

rsc63947	odours|smell		agreeable		Hence , except in particular constitutions , or in cases where their stimulus may be hurtful , they may be safely used as agreeable odours , and to obviate the smell in sick rooms , & amp ; c .
rsc63947	effluvia	moist			We come next to another , not less curious and important , part of our experiments ; the effects of the effluvia from moist , marshy , and other kinds of soils , upon air .

rsc63947	smell		noisome		The air had then contracted a noisome smell , like a new - cleaned ditch , and was diminished from 62 ~ to 49 ~ .
rsc63947	effluvia				It is probable from hence , that fine loamy vegetable earth contains little putrescent matter , as it gives little noxious effluvia .
rsc63947	effluvia		septic|noxious		So that the pure clay soils appear to be favourable to health ; they emit no kind of septic or noxious effluvia .
rsc63947	effluvia	from animal bodies			It is quickly poisoned by the effluvia from animal bodies , even whilst perfectly sweet and free from putridity .
rsc63947	aroma	parts			And this is not any ways owing to their aroma or odorous parts .

rsc69604	effluvia		noxious		And I presume it must be the same in all countries , for the same reason , which is the fear of being abandoned and left alone ; and so , when they struggle for many days against it , and at last tumble down in the street , and die suddenly , people imagine , that they were then only infected , and that they died instantly of the infection ; tho ' it may be supposed , according to the rules of the animal oeconomy , that the noxious effluvia must have been for some time mixed with the blood , before they could produce a fever , and afterwards that corruption and putrefaction in the blood and other fluids , as at last stops their circulation , and the patients die .

rsc67511	smelting	of the iron from the ore			Without any farther preface or apology , permit me to remind you , that , in a conversation which formerly passed between us upon this subject , I acquainted you , that , about twenty years since , I was engaged in making a variety of experiments upon the nature of Iron Ores , and Steel ; and that I then made a very particular enquiry into the nature of this black sand , and , in the course of these experiments , several very interesting phenomena discovered themselves , which , as they might be of great service to the world in general , and more especially to such as are concerned in smelting of the iron from the ore , I had thoughts of communicating to the public ; but , as my business will not permit me to go through the whole at present , I shall confine myself to what relates to the black sand .
rsc67511	smelt|smelting		very quick|particular		I was in hopes that if this iron sand could be wrought at all , the particles being so very fine , it would smelt very quick ; but herein I found myself mistaken , every particle has a will of its own , and must have its own particular smelting , for instead of its being performed in less time , it took more than common iron ore , but , upon farther experience , and more acquaintance with this sand , the workman has shortened the operation from five hours down to three : if by any means it might be reduced to the same time with pig iron , it would be a most useful improvement .

rsc67451	smell|odour				As to smell , there is hardly any odour , pure and simple , which will cause distinct manifestation of olfactory sensation in a monkey ; and one must study the habits of the animal carefully , or employ some volatile substance which will cause reaction .

rsc65902	Impregnation	the Ovum			On the Impregnation of the Ovum in the Amphibia .
rsc65902	impregnated				There was one exceedingly interesting fact in this experiment , - it was that the smaller and apparently less matured ova were as fully impregnated as the larger and more perfect .
rsc65902	impregnated	one			In four hours and twenty - five minutes I found one ovum partially impregnated , and the yelks of others were somewhat shrunk , and a little irregular , an appearance frequently seen in ova that have not been impregnated .
rsc65902	impregnated ova				I was unable to detect any impregnated ova in this experiment , but , as the result showed , a few had been affected , asfour embryos were produced .
rsc65902	ovum	of the Frog			All the observations I have been able to make on the ovum of the Frog , both microscopically and experimentally , are opposed to the belief in the existence of any perfo * MULLER ' S Archiv , 1836 .
rsc65902	impregnated	spermnatozoa			On this specimen , examined at the end of half an hour , I could not detect any spermnatozoa on the surface , which led me to imagine that it had not been impregnated , a supposition which ultimately proved to be correct , as no segmentation of the yelk took place in it .
rsc65902	ova				But although uninjured in the removal , and in every way carefully treated , not one gave any sign of cleavage of the yelk , which , as I have before stated , I have constantly found take place in the impregnated ova of newts as well as of frogs , although the fact of its occurrence was overlooked by RUSCONI ; not one egg afterwards produced the embryo .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			Thirty - nine ova were treated in precisely the same way , except that the interval between the application of impregnating fluid and the solution of potass was onlyfJve seconds .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			- Seventy - nine ova were bathed with the same solution of nitrate of potass as above , and three seconds afterwards with impregnating fluid in water ; the whole time occupied being twenty seconds .
rsc65902	IMPREGNATION	THE OVUM			IMPREGNATION OF THE OVUM .
rsc65902	impregnating|impregnation	spermatozoa			Thus when the solution was applied to the ovum first as in Q6 and R3 and 4 , and one 2329 second afterwards the impregnating fluid with spermatozoa , no impregnation , or but a very partial one , was effected .
rsc65902	impregnation		artificial		It was even as 2H2 235 rapid as in the artificial impregnation , R5 ( p .
rsc65902	impregnation|impregnation				Thirteenth , partial impregnation of the ovum is of fiequent occurrence , as I found in my first experiments with fluid that had passed through filtering - paper , but which still contained a very few spermatozoa , either motionless or excee ( lingly feeble ; and further , partial impregnation is of .
rsc65902	impregnating|impregnation				Thus there were seven minutes ' difference in the commencement of the changes in these two sets of ova , a circumstance which led to the belief that this difference might have some reference to the relative quantities of the impregnating fluid employed , - an opinion which I had long before been led to by observations on the impregnation of the common Earwig , Forficula , in which it had appeared to me that deficiency in the quantity of the impregnating fluid is unfavourable to fecundation .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			- One hundred and twenty - seven ova were immersed in water for three minutes , and then exposed and bathed with impregnating fluid during twenty seconds , water being immediately afterwards added to them .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			- One hundred and thirty - six ova were passed into water forfive minutes , and were then exposed and bathed with impregnating fluid for several seconds , and water immediately afterwards added to them .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			- About one hundred ova were submerged for half an hour , and impregnating fluid obtainedforty - four minutes before was then supplied to them , but not more than six or eight ova became segmented , and only two embryos were formed .
rsc65902	ovum	of the			But apart from the fact already mentioned , that the ovum of the Arnphibia affords us the best means of actual experiment on impregnation , there are questions which relate to its earlier conditions on which the observers named are not agreed , but which are of importance with regard to the physiology of reproduction in the whole of the vertebrata .
rsc65902	impregnating	fluid			In the foregoing set of experiments , the quantity of impregnating fluid supplied to the ova was but little attended to , it being added very freely in each case .
rsc65902	impregnated	the ova of toads			SPALLANZANI found that the ova of toads placed in an ice - house could be impregnated at the end of forty - one hours * .
rsc65902	impregnating	from a frog			On the other hand , I have been equally unsuccessful with ova from a frog that had been killed only two hours and a half when the impregnating fluid employed had been more than four hours and a half mixed with water .
rsc65902	impregnated	ova			SPALLANZANI has shown that in his experiments ova did not become impregnated after they had remained fifteen minutes in water .
rsc65902	impregnating|impregnating	fluid			To put this to the test , and to learn whether the difference depends entirely or chiefly on the amount of temperature , I have made two sets of experiments at precisely the same time , performed in the same way , with ova from the same female and impregnating fluid from the sanmle male , the only difference being that within a very few minutes after the impregnating fluid was supplied , one set was removed to a higher and slightly rising temperature , from which all light was excluded ; while the other was allowed to remain freely exposed to light , but in a room of ten or twelve degrees lower temperature , and which was becoming still further reduced .

rsc65843	effluvia		highly putrid|putrid		In a short time it became highly putrid and offensive : after macerating a few hours in fresh water , the saline particles in its composition began to separate , large flakes separated from its surface , and I was convinced , that if the maceration had been continued , the whole of the outer part would have crumbled away ; it was therefore suffered to dry , and the putrid effluvia gradually went off .

rsc611486	impregnation	the spermatozoon			The author commences his paper by stating that , having given direct proof , in his former paper , that the spermatozoon is the impregnating agent , and also that the liquor semiis does not effect impregnation , he now proposes to detail some new experiments which bear on the views he then advanced ; and especially with respect to the natupe of the impregnatin ' influence .

rsc610283	smell		strong		Lastly he treats of Opiats ; showing , How they affect the Animal Spirits ; in what kind of particles their force consists ; in what places they first begin to work ; how far their virtue extends , and to what parts ; what are the good and bad Effects of Opiats ; how they may allay pain without sleep ; what relief they yield in the Stone and Gout ; what help they afford to a disordered Pulse , and to Respiration ? What mischief they may work , and after what manner ? How the Turks and other devourers of Opiats are wont to be affected by them , and why they are able to take it in great quantity without harm ? And what Cautions are to be observed in the Use of them ? To all which he adds the several sorts , Praeparations , and Receipts of Opiats : Where he takes occasion to discourse of the nature of Opium it self , and of the parts wherein the Narcotick force consists ; showing withal by Experiments , that it works not equally in all Animals , and particularly not in Doggs , as it doth in Cats and Men ; teaching also the preparation of Opium , and reckoning up the Opiats both of the Ancients and Moderns ; and further instructing his Reader , that the best Menstruum for making liquid Laudanum ' s , is Spirit of Wine impregnated with the volatilized salt of Tartar ; this having a peculiar virtue of speedy dissolving the mass of Opium , of taking a Ruby - like tincture , and of somewhat subduing its Narcotick sulphur , and taking away its strong smell .

rsc61808	Effluvia		Electrick		There were made two Cubes of Oak , of about six Inches Square , the one solid , the other hollow : These were suspended by two Hair - Lines , nearly after the same Manner as in the Experiment above - mentioned ; the Distance of the Cubes from each other , was by Estimation , about fourteen or fifteen Feet ; the Line of Communication being tied to each Hair - Line , and the Leaf - Brass placed under the Cubes , the Tube was rubbed and held over the Middle of the Line , and as near as could be guessed , at equal Distances from the Cubes , when both of them attracted and repelled the LeafBrass at the same Time , and to the same Hight ; so that there seemed to be no more Attraction in the solid than in the hollow Cube ; yet I am apt to think that the Electrick Effluvia pass through all the interior Parts of the solid Cube , though no Part but the Surface attracts ; for from several Experiments it appears , that if any other Body touches that which attracts , its Attraction ceases till that Body be removed , and the other be again excited by the Tube .
rsc61808	Effluvia				Though the going and returning of the Electrick Effluvia was very surprising , yet we were willing to try how far the attractive Virtue might be carried in a continued right Line ; the Method of doing which was thus : That End of the Line where the Attraction was to be made , was suspended on a Silk Line that was fixed cross the Garret Window on the North - side of the House , which was by Estimation about forty Feet high ; at about an hundred Feet from hence two Rods or Poles of about ten Feet long , and at two Feet distance from each other , were drove into the Ground , so as that they stood nearly perpendicular .

rsc612020	smell		unpleasant		I know , there are some Corrosive Spirits , as in Nitre and Salt , simple , or compounded of them , that , when they are very strong , emit for a while manifest fumes ; but the difference of those Liquors , and their inferiority to our red Spirit , in the Capacity of smoaking Liquors , might easily enough be manifested , if it were judged proper in this place , where it may suffice , to take notice of these two things : The one is , That when the Viol has lain stopped and quiet a competent time , the upper half of it will appear destitute of fumes , of which the Air , it seems , will imbibe , and constantly retain but a certain moderate quantity , which may give some light towards the Reason , Why the same Air , which will be quite clogged with steams , will not long serve for Respiration , which requires frequent supplies of fresh Air : The other is , That if the unstoppd Viol were placed in our Vacuum , it would not emit any visible steams at all , nor so much as to appear in the upper part of the Glass it self that held the Liquor ; whereas , when the Air was by degrees restored at the stopcock , without moving the Receiver it self , to avoid injuring its closeness , the returning Air would presently raise the fumes , first into the vacant part of the Viol , whence they would ascend into the Capacity of the Receiver ; and likewise , when the Air , that was requisite to support them , was pumped out , they also accompanied it , as their unpleasant smell evinced , and the red Spirit , though it remained unstopped , emitted no more fumes till the new Air was let in .
rsc612020	smell	of it			To surmount these difficulties , the first thing I thought on was , to take a fine limber and clear Bladder of a sheep or hog , made more transparent by being anointed with Oil , which was done on the outside , that the smell of it might less offend the Animal to be included .

rsc61465	impregnating	vitriolick Salts			Though the Want of Wood in Cornwal deprives it of the Advantages it might otherways reap from Iron as a Metal , we shall nevertheless find it far from being a useless Oar , when we consider it as sometimes impregnating the Waters with vitriolick Salts , thereby making them a proper Menstruum for dissolving the disseminated Particles of Metals ; sometimes destroying the sulphureous Menstrua , which ( tho ' they dissolve the disseminated Metals ) do nevertheless obstruct their new Concretions ; and sometimes as being it self the Magnet by which the metallic Particles are attracted into new Concretions .
rsc61469	smell		sulphureous|so great		The sulphureous smell was so great , I cannot describe it , and the heat I felt on my cheek and head not to be conceived , without the same being felt .

rsc615499	impregnation|impregnated	frogs			And the analogy favourable to this opinion has probably been taken from the impregnation of frogs and toads , in which process we are told , on the authority of RoESEL , SWAM MERDAM , and SPALLANZANI ' , the ova are impregnated by the male as they are passing from the body of the female ; and that in water newts the ova are impregnated even without copulation .

rsc66213	perfume|aromatic		grateful		There would be strong temptations to do this from the great demand for it , and the expense and difficulty of distant inland carriage ; and as it was much used as a perfume , being brought into Greece and Italy in the form of an unguent manufactured in Laodicea , Tarsus , and other towns of Syria and Asia Minor , it is probable , that any grateful aromatic resembling it was allowed to pass for it .
rsc66213	perfume	the unguentum nardinum	favourite		The favourite perfume which was used at the ancient baths and feasts was the unguentum nardinum ; and it appears , from a passage in HORACE , that it was so valuable , that as much of it as could be contained in a small box of precious stone was considered as a sort of equivalent for a large vessel of wine , and a handsome quota for a guest to contribute at an entertainment , according to the custom of antiquity : Nardo vinum merebere Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum .

rsc67800	smell	particles			- The dorsal tentacles , which have never been observed to be used as tactile organs , we believe to be the seat of the sense of smell ; and this belief is strengthened when we reflect that these organs are most highly developed and minutely lamiinated ; that they are most plentiful lie supplied with nerves from ganglia placed in front of all the rest of the cerebral masses ; that they are exte ' nally covered with vibratile cilia , and so placed on the head as easily to receive impressions from any odorous particles that may be mingled with the circumambient water .

rsc614162	odour|smell		fragrant|very unpleasant		brown tincture was thus formed , which , by evaporation , afforded a deep browxn substance , possessing all the properties of resin , being insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol , and in ether ; it also speedily melted , when placed on a red - hot iron , burned with much flame , and emitted a fragrant odour , totally unlike the very unpleasant smell produced by burning the coal itself , or by burning any of the common bituminous substances .
rsc614162	odour		fetid		But this small quantity was sufficient to prove , that although the Bovey coal does not contain any vegetable extract , like the schistus formerly mentioned , yet the whole of the proximate principles of the original vegetable have not been entirely changed ; as a small portion of true resin , not converted into bitumen , still remains inherent in the coal , although the bituminous part is by much the most prevalent , and causes the fetid odour which attends the combustion of this substance .
rsc614162	scent		very agreeable|aromatic		MILLES , in his remarks on the Bovey coal , ( which I have several times had occasion to notice in the course of this Paper , ) states , that """" amongst the clay , but adhering to the coal , are """" found lumps of a bright yellow loam , extremely light , and so """" saturated with petroleum , that they burn like sealing wax , """" emitting a very agreeable and aromatic scent .
rsc614162	odour		faint resinous		It dQes not apparently become softened , when held for some time in the hand , but emits a faint resinous odour .
rsc614162	odour		very fragrant		When placed on a heated iron , it immediately melts , smokes much , burns with a bright flame , and yields a very fragrant odour , like some of the sweet - scented resins , blt which at last becomes slightly tainted with that of asphaltumn .
rsc614162	odour		resinous		The solution was reddish - brown , and had a resinous odour ; by the addition of water it became milky , and , by evaporation , afforded a dark brown substance , which had every property of resin , whilst the residuum left by the alcohol possessed those properties which characterize asphaltum .
rsc614162	odour		asphalturn|disagreeable		It burned with the odour of asphalturn , but rather ' ess disagreeable , owing most probably to a small portion of the resin , which had not been completely extracted by the alcohol .
rsc614162	odour	of petroleum			From asphaltum , the alcohol had extracted a yellow tinctures which , in some situations , appeared of a pale olive colour , and , being spontaneously evaporated , a thick brown liquid was deposited , in small drops , on the glass ; these drops did not become hard after two months , and possessed the odour , and every other property , of petroleum .
rsc614162	odour				The alcohol which had been digested on pit coal , had not assumed any colour ; but , by spontaneous evaporation , * it left a film on the glass , which , by its odour , was also found to be petroleum .
rsc614162	odour		not disagreeable		When applied to the flame of a candle , it burns and melts like sealing - wax , at the same time diffusing an odour which is not disagreeable .
rsc614162	odour	of the unburned schistus			My suspicion was excited , partly byr the odour produced during combustion , which rather more resembled that of wood than that of charcoal , and partly by the brown solution formed by digesting the powder of the unburned schistus in boiling distilled water ; for , by various tests I ascertained , that the substance thus dissolved was not of a mineral nature .
rsc614162	odour				When burned , it emitted smoke , with the odour of vegetable matter .
rsc614163	odour	indigo			When heated it sublimed in purple vapours ; and on further application of heat it evolved empyreumatic vapours , which possessed the properties of aniline and the odour of burnt indigo .
rsc614163	smell		medicinal		In June 1852 , a sample of urine freely exposed to the air in an open vessel , was observed after four or five days ' exposure gradually to change colour ; the pellicle or scum which had formed on the surface of the urine became at first slate - coloured , and at length deep blue , with here and there a rusty - red tint : the urine also underwent , at the same time , some remarkable changes , becoming thick and turbid , deep brown , greenish , bluish - green , and finally of a faded yellowish - green colour ; a considerable sediment was found at the bottom of the glass , this was deep brown , soft and deliquescent , intermixed with a little blue colouring matter , and it had a medicinal smell resembling somewhat that of valerian .
rsc614163	odour	nan Cyanourine			Cyanourine is described as a dark blue powder , destitute either of taste or odour ; it is scarcely soluble in water , moderately so in boiling alcohol ( the solution being blue ) , but it is deposited on cooling .
rsc614163	odour		highly ammoniacal		- The urine of the second sample at the time of analysis , when shaken up , had a dark greenish - brown colour , was strongly alkaline both from fixed and volatile alkalies , and emitted a highly ammoniacal odour .

rsc616148	smell|smelling|smell|smell	water|fish|air|water|particles			When we consider these animals as quadrupeds , and only constructed differently in external form for progressive motion through water , we must see that it was necessary that all the senses should correspond with this medium : we must therefore be at a loss to conceive how they smell , since we may observe , that the organ for smelling water , as in fish , is very different from that formed to smell air ; and as we must suppose this tribe are only to smell water , being the medium in which such odoriferous particles can be diffused , we should expect their organ to be similar to that of fish ; but in that case nature would have been obliged to have attached the nose of a fish to an animal constructed like a quadruped ; and it is contrary to the laws which are established in the animal creation to mix parts of different animals together .
rsc616148	smell|smell	water			In many of this tribe there is no organ of smell at all ; and in those which have such an organ , it is not that of a fish , therefore probably not calculated to smell water .
rsc616148	smell|smelling|smells	the water|parts|the fish			It becomes difficult , therefore , to account for the manner in which such animals smell the water ; and why the others should not have had such an organ * , * Is the mode of smelling in fish similar to tasting in other animals ? Or is the air contained in the water impregnated with the odoriferous parts , and this air the fish smells ? If so , it is somewhat similar to the breathing of fish , it not being the water which produces the effect there , but the air contained in it .
rsc616148	smell|impregnated|smell	particles			Although it is not the external air which they inspire that produces smell , I believe it is the air retained in the nostril out of the current of respiration , which by being impregnated with the odoriferous particles contained in the water during the act of blowing , is applied to the organ of smell .
rsc616148	smell|smell|smell	the air|particles of|prey			It might be supposed , that they could smell the air on the surface of the water by every inspiration , as animals do on land ; and probably they may : but this will not give them the power to smell the odoriferous particles of their prey in the water at any depth ; and as their organ is not fitted to be affected by the application of water , and as they cannot suck water into the nostril , without the danger of its passing into the lungs , it cannot be by its application to this organ that they are enabled to smell .
rsc616148	smell|smelling	air|of the external air			As the organ appears to be formed to smell air only , and as I conceive the smelling of the external air could not be of use as a sense .
rsc616148	smell|smell	particles of|water			I therefore believe , that they do not smell in inspiration ; yet let us consider how they may be supposed to smell the odoriferous particles of the water .
rsc616148	smell|impregnates|smell				The organ of smell is out of the direct road of the current of air in inspiration ; it is also out of the current of water when they spout ; may we not suppose then , that this sinus contains air , and as the water passes in the act of throwing it out , that it impregnates this reservoir of air , which immediately affects the sense of smell .

rsc64099	smell|smell		bituminous|intolerable faetid		One pound of Bovey coal , of the woody kind , powdered , put into a glass retort , and distilled in sand , yielded four ounces and a half of phlegm , which had the appearance of common water , but somewhat of a bituminous smell and taste ; near four ounces of a turbid whitish bituminous liquor , of an intolerable faetid smell , and extremely pungent to the tongue ; about two drachms of a heavy bituminous matter , which would not mix with the liquor above - mentioned , but sunk entirely to the bottom , and ( which is very remarkable ) there was not the least appearance of any light oil floating on the bituminous liquor .

rsc613027	Effluvia				HAving Prosecuted the Experiments of Attrition on the outside of Glass with some Success , Several notable Phenomenon having been exhibited by them , ( and I think what the World in a great measure has not been acquainted withal before , ) I thought it would not be amiss to continue them a little farther , by trying what Appearances might be afforded by placing the Woollen Threads , as heretofore used on the outside , on the Axis within , and the Attrition to be made on the outward surface as usual ; not ~ , if any such Effluvia were by that means emitted within , that then the Threads , which should be fixed on the Axis , would extend themselves , and point every ways towards the Circumference of it .
rsc613027	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvium				Now when this Experiment was made by hanging the Threads near the outside , it was very odd ( as before related ) to see them fly the Approach of a Finger ; yet how much more surprising is it , to see the same performed even when a Body so solid as Glass interposes ; which shows the subtilty of the Effluvia , the Body from which it is produced seeming to be no Impediment to its motion : Besides it seems very much to resemble or emulate a Solid , since Motion may be given to a Body , by pushing the Effluvia at some distance from it : But what is still more strange is , That this Body ( I presume to call it so ) altho ' so subtle as seemingly to perviate Glass , will not ( as I have taken notice of in a former Experiment ) affect a light Body thro ' a piece of Mnslin : Now whether the Muslin absorps the Effluvium , or what other Laws it may be subject to , I cannot tell , but sure I am it is very amazing , and I think , with submission , worthy the Consideration of this Honourable Society .

rsc613027	Effluvia	of Glass	very considerable		) THAT the Effluvia of Glass are very considerable in the Production of divers Phenomenon , has already been abundantly proved ; but that they should act the Part of a Solid Body , by performing the Office of one , is still more admirable ; And that they do so , the following Experiment sufficiently demonstrates , and seems to coroberate a hint I gave in the 2d Experiment of their Emulating such a Body , by causing a Thread to fly the approaching Finger .

rsc613027	Effluvia|Effluvia		Electrical		IN the late Experiments , which seem something to Illustrate Attraction or Electricity , by the Ends of the surrounding Threads pointing to the Axis of the Affricated Glass , there is something farther very Remarkable , and worthy Consideration ; which is , That after the Attrition of the Glass has been a little while continued , and the Effluvia laid hold on the hairy or woolly Threads , ( for I made use of such as we call Crewel , ) that then , notwithstanding the rubbing was ceased , and the Glass motionless , yet all the Threads would continue their directed Posture for four or five Minutes , and sometimes longer , before they could disengage themselves from the Attracting or Electrical Effluvia .

rsc611008	impregnated	Alkaly			By Mounsieur de la Chambre , it is affirmed that three or four days before the Nile begins to overflow , there falls a certain dew which hath a fermenting virtue , and leavens a past exposed to the air , and at that time saith Pliny , and Mounsieur de la Chambre the Nitre Pits grow full of Nitre , and Sands Vanslebius and several say , that tho 500 in a day die in Grand Cairo of the Plague before the beginning of the inundation of Nile , yet the very day after there does not one die , which doubtless could not proceed from any other reason , then because at that time , the air was impregnated with this Volatile Alkaly , for at that time the Nitre Pits grow full and this dew falls ; ( this I think ) may sufficiently hint to us the great use of its volatile spirit especially in pestilential distempers .

rsc615384	- scented	Tobacco			But to insist no further herein , than as this may be applicable to the present Discourse : for I have observed , that that which is called Pine - wood Land , tho ' it be a sandy Soil , even the Sweet - scented Tobacco that grows thereon , being large and porous , agreeable to Aranoko Tobacco ; it smoaks as coursly as Aranoko : wherefore it is , that I believe the Microscope might make notable Discoveries towards the knowledge of good Tobacco : for the closer the Composition of the Leaf , the better the Tobacco ; and therefore the Planters and Merchants brag of the Substance of their Tobacco ; which word , did they always take it in a true sense , for the Solidness , and not mistake it for the Thickness , it would be more consonant to a true Observation : for as I said of the Pine - wood Tobacco , some of it is thick and not solid , and differs from the best Tobacco , as Buff does from Tanned Leather ; so that if the Tobacco be sound and not rotten , you may give a great guess at the goodness of Tobacco , when you weigh the Hogsheads , before you see them : for if an equal care be taken in the Packing of them , the best Tobacco will weigh the heaviest , and pack the closest .

rsc64912	smelting	lead			But though lead and sulphur , a liquid and air , are unquestionably constituent parts of lead ore , I do not take upon me to say , that they are the only constituent parts : it is well known , that , during the smelting of lead ore , a third part or more of its weight is somehow or other lost , since from one and twenty hundred weight of ore they seldom obtain above fourteen hundred weight of lead .
rsc64912	smelting	a lead ore			They were employed this year at Holywell in smelting a lead ore from the Isle of Man ; the ore was rich in silver .
rsc64912	smelled	of sulphur			Six ounces of fine tessellated lead ore were put into a crucible and exposed , at first , to a gentle , afterwards to a strong fire : the ore grew red , and emitted fumes which smelled of sulphur ; at length it melted , and the fumes became very copious ; they were accompanied with a yellowish flame upon the surface of the melted ore , and when collected had a whitish appearance .
rsc64912	smell		strong		Sixteen ounces of this ore , thus previously cleansed , were distilled in an earthen retort ; as soon at the ore felt the fire , the stopple of the quilled receiver had a strong smell resembling that of the inflammable air separable from some metals by solution in acids ; soon after a small portion of a liquid came over into the receiver ; the fire was then raised till the retort was of a white heat , when a black matter began to be sublimed into the neck of the retort ; the operation was then discontinued .

rsc64912	smell	The liquid	pungent		The liquid , notwithstanding , had an acid taste , and a pungent smell , resembling that of the volatile vitriolic acid .
rsc64912	smell		pungent		From one hundred and twenty parts , by weight , of lead ore , I obtained , by solution in acid of nitre , subsequent washing in hot water , and drying by a gentle fire , forty parts of a substance which looked like sulphur : these forty parts were put on a red - hot iron , the sulphur was made manifest by a blue flame and pungent smell .
rsc64914	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia				So even in this Experiment ( I have just now been relating ) allowing a Continuum of Parts , ( as I see no reason to the contrary ) the Effluvia within , and those without , are all of a Piece , ( for they are both begot by the same Attrition ) that when the Effluvia are pushed , or disturbed without , the Effluvia within , in the same direction are so too , and consequently the Threads which are upheld and directed by ' em .
rsc64914	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia				The Effluvia which are provoked from the Glass , seem to be , and are nothing else but part of the same Body exerted from it by rubbing ; therefore ( I think ) can be no Impediment to the Motion of its own Effluvia , for otherwise I do not see how the Effluvia within , can be produced by an Attrition without .
rsc64914	Effluvia	of Glass			And for a farther Confirmation that the Effluvia of Glass act not but in a Continuum of their Parts , take the following Experiments .
rsc64914	Effluvia|Effluvia	Glass			And it may be remembred , that it is mentioned in the Experiment for producing Light by the Effluvia of the outward Glass falling on the inward exhausted Glass in Motion , that after the Motions were ceased , it was but approaching one ' s Hand near the Surface of the outward Glass , to produce a Light in the inward one : Whence , by these Experiments it is plain , the Effluvia within were pushed more vigorously on the inward Glass , by the approach of the Hand without , otherwise no Light would have ensued .
rsc64914	Effluvia|Effluvia				And farther to prove the stiffness of the Body of the Effluvia , it is observable , that when a piece of Leaf - Brass is hunted about a Room , that the Brass swims or floats on the Surface of the Effluvia ; and as that is more or less exerted , so the Brass keeps its distance from it , nor will by any means be suffered to sink within it ' s Sphere , unless it meets with a Body in its way , and then it is attracted and returned again several times with great swiftness .
rsc64914	Effluvia	of the Affricated Tube			Having tried the Effect of the discontinuing or interrupting of the Effluvia of the Affricated Tube on its outward Surface , I was willing to try what would ensue , by filling its Cavity with a Body , which I did , by plugging up one end of it with a Cork , then pouring in at the other dry Writing Sand till it was near full : After that , the Attrition was diligently made , and when held towards the pieces of Brass as usual , no motion was given , till it arrived within an Inch or thereabouts of them .
rsc64919	stench		intolerable		By these means , there was a separation begun ; in two days , the edges of the burnt parts beginning to separate , when I thought to assist nature by deep scarification ; but , to my very great surprise , I could no more thrust my knife through the burnt parts , than through hide leather , or a thong ; by which means , the separation was rather slow , and the stench intolerable .

rsc613293	smell		highly virose		The leaves of hemlock are most fit for medicinal purposes , as being in their greatest perfection , when collected in dry weather , from the middle of May to the time that their flowering stems begin to shoot ; as by that time the plants will have felt the effects of the warm sun , have acquired an highly virose smell , and the stems of the leaves are covered with purple spots , an argument of the exaltation of their juices : and we should be attentive here to give them all these advantages , as three degrees of latitude , and other circumstances of soil and situation , may occasion a very sensible difference in the qualities of the same plant ; an instance of which occurs in the plant under consideration , and may be one of the causes , why the effects of the hemlock have not been such here , as we are assured they are at Vienna ; viz .
rsc613293	smell	of hemlock	specific|comparatively weak		In such mild winters as the last , the leaves of hemlock may be procured in any part of them ; but they are not to be depended upon , as their specific smell is then comparatively weak , their juices poor and watery , and they are wholly without spots .

rsc64937	Effluvia|those		different		In short , I find no difference in the Laws of the different Effluvia , tho ' those of Glass seem to be much the strongest , and to act with the greatest Vigour .
rsc64937	Effluvia				This in a great measure bespeaks the Weakness of its Effluvia .
rsc64937	Effluvia				From all which Experiments it appears to me , that the largeness or littleness of Light or Attraction , producible from Bodies by Attrition , proceeds from the Number and Strength of their Respective Effluvia , and so of all Bodies reciprocally falling under the same Classis .
rsc64937	Effluvia	Heterogeneous Body			But that those Threads contained in the same Globe , should have motion given them by the Effluvia of an Heterogeneous Body separate from it , and the Globe at the same time to have no manner of motion or Attrition given it , is very amazing ; and that it is so , is matter of fact .
rsc64937	Effluvia		moist		But this Appearance will not always succeed ; for some time after endeavouring the same Experiment , I could by no means make it answer as before : The Temperature of the Air being then altered , its moist Effluvia were condensed on the Glass ; and so long as it remained under such Circumstance , it was attempting it in vain .
rsc64937	Effluvia		Humid		But I found , that if the Glass was a little warmed by the Fire , or placed a while in the Sunshine , or well rub ' d with a warm dry Linen Cloath ; any of which , whereby the Humid Effluvia might be evaporated , that then the included Pieces of Leaf - Brass would , from the affricated Wax , have as brisk a Motion given them as before .
rsc64937	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia		moist|Humid		Now , whether the Fire , Sunshine , or the rubbing the Glass with a warm dry Linen Cloath , not only clears it from the moist Effluvia condensed on it , but likewise gives motion to the Particles of the Glass itself : Which Motion seems to produce Effluvia , which in conjuction with that of the Sealing - Wax , facilitates its Action on the premention ' d Bodies ; and that it does so , I conclude from this Particular : That when I had warmed the Glass by the Fire , or had evaporated the Humid Effluvia by any of the other means , I found I could give Motion to the included Brass Bodies , by only rubbing my Finger on the outside of it , without the assistance of the Wax .
rsc64937	Effluvia	the Wax			But if the Air be naturally warm , and free from Humid Vapours , there needs none of the prementioned means to assist the Effluvia of the Wax to give Motion to the included Brass Bodies : Yet at the same time I must believe , that the Particles of the Glass are then in a greater Motion , than when the Experiment will not succeed .
rsc64937	Effluvia|Effluvia	of the Wax|Glass			What farther I have to take notice of is , that the Effluvia of the Wax may very sensibly be felt on the Back of the Hand , the Wax being moved to and fro near it , as I have formerly taken notice of the like sensible Stroaks given by the Effluvia of Glass .

rsc64792	impregnation		saline		In what degree the medicinal powers of Harrogate water depend on its sulphureous , and in what degree on its saline impregnation , are questions which I meddle not with : I would only just observe on this head , that any strong sulphureous water , such as that of Keddlestone in Derbyshire , or of Shap in Westmoreland , which naturally contains little or no sea salt , may be rendered similar to Harrogate water , by dissolving in it a proper proportion of common salt .

rsc69104	smell|smell		Sulphureous|highly Sulphureous		That Vitriol contains Sulphur , is evinced by the Sulphureous smell it emits in distillation , especially if urgent with a strong fire from the beginning , and the Spirit thus drawn being rectified , the Liquor , which first arises , hath a highly Sulphureous smell , as hath also that we shall hereafter mention , distilled from Vitriol deprived of its Matallick Parts , The Colcothar dulcified , or Metallic parts precipitated by an Alcali , or immature Mineral , sublimed with Sal Armoniack , an inflammable Sulphur may be many ways separated both from the sublimate and Caput mortuum .
rsc69104	smell		so subtle|penetrating|insupportable		This Liquor rectified in a very tall Body , immediately upon the approach of the smallest Degree of Heat a volatile Sulphureous Spirit did arise , clear as Rock - water almost , nay I think altogether insipid ; yet the smell so subtle and penetrating , that it was insupportable : And such it continued many years , not letting fall any sediment , and thereby losing its strength , as doth the volatile Spirits made out of Common Vitriol .

rsc69043	smell		so strong		Volatile sal ammoniac requires a great deal of water to dissolve it , and the solution has not near so strong a smell as the spirits of sal ammoniac made with fixed alcali ; the reason of which is , that the latter contain much less fixed air .

rsc69043	smell		more penetrating		It is highly probable too , that the same thing happens in dissolving these metallic substances in the nitrous acid ; as the fumes produced during the solution appear plainly to consist in great measure of the nitrous acid , and yet it appears , from their more penetrating smell and other reasons , that the acid must have undergone some change in its nature , which can hardly be attributed to any thing else than its union with the phlogiston .

rsc62539	smelt				The acid matter in the other tube was abundant ; its taste was sour ; it smelt like water over which large quantities of nitrous gas have been long kept ; it did not affect solution of muriate of barytes ; and a drop of it placed upon a polished plate of silver left after evaporation a black stain , precisely similar to that produced by extremely diluted nitrous acid .
rsc62539	smell	of peach blossoms			Green colouring matter , with resin , alkali , and lime , appeared in the negative vessel : and the positive vessel contained a clear fluid , which had the smell of peach blossoms ; and which , when neutralized by potash , gave a blue - green precipitate to solution of sulphate of iron ; so that it contained vegetable prussic acid .

rsc6991	odour|odour		peculiar|characteristic		A preliminary experiment showed that water acted upon it energetically , the solid became transitorily coloured yellow , a peculiar odour was developed , similar to that produced when iodine is dissolved in a solution of a caustic alkali , and the water became impregnated with alcohol , for on being treated with acetate of potash and sulphuric acid , it gave the characteristic odour of acetic ether .
rsc6991	odour		peculiar ethereal		it exhaled a peculiar ethereal odour and became of a bright yellow colour ; this ingredient is present , however , in small quantity only , and I have not succeeded in isolating it ; possibly it is either aldehyde , or some product of the action of zincethyl upon acetic acid .

rsc645	smell|odours	by various metals			The smell emitted by various metals when rubbed may be objected to these conclusions , but the circumstances under which these odours are produced , are such , as not to leave any serious objections on my mind to the opinions above advanced .
rsc6661	smell|smelling	the impurities	considerable		Where the impurities mixed with the air have any considerable smell , our sense of smelling may be able to discover them , though the quantity is vastly too small to phlogisticate the air in such a degree as to be perceived by the nitrous test , even though those impurities impart their phlogiston to the air very freely .

rsc6661	smell|smell		strong|very strong		For instance , the great and instantaneous power of nitrous air in phlogisticating common air is well known ; and yet ten ounce measures of nitrous air , mixed with the air of a room upwards of twelve feet each way , is sufficient to communicate a strong smell to it , though its effect in phlogisticating the air must be utterly insensible to the nicest Eudiometer ; for that quantity of nitrous air is not more than the 140000th part of the air of the room , and therefore can hardly alter its test by more than ~ / 140000 or 1 / 47000th part ~ Liver of sulphur also phlogisticates the air very freely , and yet the air of a room will acquire a very strong smell from a quantity of it vastly too small to phlogisticate it in any sensible degree .
rsc6661	smelling	nitrous air			There is no reason to suppose from these instances , either that these substances have not much tendency to phlogisticate the air , or that nitrous air is not a true test of its phlogistication , as both these points have been sufficiently proved by experiment ; it only shows , that our sense of smelling can , in many cases , perceive infinitely smaller alterations in the purity of the air than can be per3 ceived Fig .

rsc66957	impregnated	Vitriol|Brimstone			This to me seems the reason , why Vitriol and Brimstone are usually found together , those minerals and pyrites that bound with one , being usually impregnated with the other ; Vitriol not being a distinct principle , but the genuine off - spring of sulphur , its material cause , and fire and air the efficient causes of its production .
rsc66957	Smell		intolerably sulphureous		I once made out of Vitriol , common Salt , and Antimony , a Liquor clear as any Fountain - water , yet the Smell intolerably sulphureous , continuing so many years : And true inflamable Sulphur may several ways be recovered out of Oil of Vitriol , or Sulphur , many times rectified , and in appearance free from such mixture .
rsc66811	smell		acid|extremely faint		The solution of the fossil alkali mixed clear , as did a solution of salt of tartar , but each drop of a solution of common caustic alkali gave a white cloud ; some oil of vitriol dropped on a little of this salt effervesced , and emitted acid fumes , while it yet was mixed with a good deal of the yellow oily matter ; but after the salt was dissolved in distilled water , and again crystallised , and freed of most of this yellow matter , no fumes were to be observed ; and the acid smell was extremely faint when strong spirit or oil of vitriol was dropped upon it .
rsc66811	smell		strong sulphureous		The Castle - Loed is a strong sulphureous mineral water ; when taken up from the spring , it is as pure and transparent as the clearest rock water ; but if kept in an open vessel , or an ill - corked bottle , it soon becomes of a milky sort of foulness , and it loses its strong sulphureous smell in twentyfour hours .
rsc66811	smell		very suffocating sulphureous		The bottom of the well , and of the channel which conveys its water from thence , is black , as if dyed with ink ; and the leaves of the aller bushes that fall into the well , or into its channel , soon contract a blackish colour in the water ; but when taken out , and dried in the sun or shade , appear covered with a whitish dust , which is undoubtedly sulphur ; for , by burning one or more on an ignited shovel , or clear live coal , they produce a blue flame , and emit a very suffocating sulphureous smell .
rsc66811	smell		fetid sulphureous		It had then a fetid sulphureous smell , resembling somewhat that of a foul gun or of rotten eggs , and it tinged silver in the same way as the sulphureous waters beforementioned ; and it had a sulphureous and slight saltish taste .
rsc66811	smell		fetid sulphureous		This fetid sulphureous smell , taste , and property of tinging silver , which this as well as most other salt waters acquire by keeping , I suspect to be owing to a fermentation taking place in the water , and slightly uniting some of the fine oily matter with some of the acid of the salts which these waters contain , and thus forming a sulphureous vapour which is volatile while they remain slightly united , but which by a more intimate union would form a real fixed sulphur .
rsc66811	smell		very strong sulphureous		It had still a very strong sulphureous smell and taste ; but it had no other but a sulphureous taste , and it made no impression , on the tongue , of sea or any other salt .

rsc66811	smell	Some oil of vitriol|of sea salt	strong pungent acid		Some oil of vitriol dropped on some of this matter occasioned very little effervescence , but raised a strong pungent acid smell , which I at first imagined must be that of sea salt ; but , from the few marks I have observed of the existence of this salt in a perfect state in these waters , I have since thought , that it might be that of a volatile vitriolic acid , which had been formed by the union of some of the acid of the Glauber salt , with a sulphureous or oily matter , and dislodged by the addition of a fixed acid of the same kind , though perhaps there may be a pittance of a calculareous marine salt in the yellow ley mixed with the Glauber salt .

rsc66811	smell		strong sulphureous		I subjected it to the same trials , as it : on opening the bottles , it emitted a strong sulphureous smell , tinged silver , and produced nearly the same appearances as the Castle - Loed when mixed with the same substances , only it remained clear when a solution of the true fossil alkali was mixed with it ; the caustic vegetable alkali occasioned a very small light , darkish cloud , and precipitated but a very small quantity of a very light sediment , owing , as appeared afterwards , to this water containing an absorbent or calcarious earth , which probably was suspended by air , and but very little if any selenite .

rsc6986	efflux|efflux				But as the water which flows in from the Atlantic is salt instead of fresh , and is itself rendered still more dense by concentration in the Mediterranean , the constantly renewed excess m the weight of the Mediterranean column can only relieve itself by as continual an efflux : this efflux , by lowering the surface - level , in its turn occasions an indraught to maintain it ; and thus the in - current has to replace nor only the fresh water lost by excess of evaporation , but also the denser water forced out by its excess of weight .

rsc613395	Smelling				These two Cavities are of great use , for they draw up and contain as much Water as serves the Animal at once , which afterward it empties into the Mouth , as it were from a Tunnel : They serve also for Breathing , Smelling , and uttering the Voice .
rsc613395	Smell		most acute		This Hole is not so considerable in Human Subjects , but larger in Quadrupeds , especially Its Blood ally such as feed upon Grass or Hay ; insomuch , that by the bigness of this Branch of the 5th Pair in an Ox or Hart , we may reasonably conjecture they have a partial Taste , and a most acute Smell by the Upper Lip , the better to enable them to chuse their Food : For at the Dissection of a Calfs Head , you ' ll perceive both this Nerve and the Blood Vessels much bigger than what might be thought requisite for furnishing either Blood or Spirits to this part , were there not some extraordinary use for both .
rsc613395	Smelling		a most acute		This extraordinary part did not want for Nerves sufficient for it , no more than Blood Vessels : For first , it has the Nervus Olfactorius , whereof hereafter ; whereby it is endued with a most acute Sensation of Smelling .

rsc613395	smells				When they go in Troops , if one of them perceives an Herb on which any Man has trampled , he pulls it up , and delivers it to the next , who smells it and gives it to a third , and so on till it come to the last , who makes a great Noise , upon which all go to flight , and retire to Hills , Mountains , Shady , and other less frequented Places , where when there is no more Grass , some dig up Roots , others go and pull tender Buds , Herbs and Leaves of Trees ; and the first that finds any thing , returns and convenes the rest of the Flock , that he may communicate to them what he has purchased .
rsc613395	Smell		Urinous		As to the second , tho ' he might have been sensible of an abounding Urinous Salt in that Animal , it does not follow it should be so in all , and I am apt to believe it was extraordinary ; for without doubt such a burning as the poor Beast underwent , even to its Death , must have altered the Constitution of its Blood , and made it quite different from what it was ; and it is probable , that it was at such places , as were most affected with the Burning , where he felt this Urinous Smell , and the smarting of his Finger .

rsc615294	Effluvia				There is considerable Difficulty in firing Electrics per se , such as Turpentine and Balsam Capivi , by the repulsive Power of Electricity ; because , in this Case , these Substances will not permit the Electricity to pass through them : Therefore , when you would have this Experiment succeed , the Finger of the Person who is to fire them , is to be applied as near to the Edge as possible of these Substances when warmed in a Spoon , that the Flashes from the Spoon ( for these Substances will emit none ) may snap , where they are spread the thinnest , and then fire their Effluvia .

rsc615000	odour		peculiar|more highly fetid|offensive		In the same patient the appearance of the discharge is frequently varied by internal remedies , or by external applications ; but if we except the temporary variations produced by accidental circumstances , the cancerous ulcer is , in its advanced stage , very generally accompanied with a peculiar odour more highly fetid and offensive than that which is emitted by other malignant ulcers .
rsc615000	smell		empyreumatic		A little spirit of wine being introduced into the jar , this viscid substance was dissolved ; the spirit acquired a yellow colour and empyreumatic smell , and upon adding to it distilled water the mixture became whitish and slightly turbid .
rsc615000	smell		fetid		To another portion of distilled water saturated with this fluid , dephlogisticated marine acid being added , the fetid smell was destroyed , a brisk effervescence took place , and a whitish gelatinous substance was separated .
rsc615000	smell		empyreumatic		It is proper to observe , that the air extricated from the putrid veal had less of the empyreumatic smell than that which was disengaged from fresh animal substances .
rsc615000	odour|that				Its odour indeed was nearly similar to that of animal substances in a state of putrefaction .
rsc615000	odour		fetid		The portion that is insoluble burns with a lambent flame , and has all the characters of heavy inflammable air ; whereas the soluble part resembles the fluid which is extricated from cancerous matter by the vitriolic acid : it has a fetid odour , it decomposes nitrated silver , combines with caustic volatile alkali , and possesses many of the properties of common hepatic air .
rsc615000	odours		not exactly similar		Although they are both fetid , yet their odours are not exactly similar .

rsc615000	smelled	of animal hepatic air	strongly		The portion of the liquor which now remained had a faint yellow colour ; it smelled strongly of animal hepatic air , and deposited a brown precipitate upon the addition of nitrated silver .
rsc615000	odour	the cancerous matter	peculiar		By the vegetable fixed alkali no sensible change was produced : upon the addition of the vitriolic acid , the liquor in the second glass acquired a deep brown colour , a brisk effervescence took place , and at the same time the peculiar odour of the cancerous matter was greatly increased , and diffused itself to a considerable distance through the surrounding air .

rsc615000	fetor				Upon the addition of the acid , the liquor , as before , acquired a brown colour , its fetor was much increased , and a manifest effervescence took place , although it was not so considerable as in the former instance .
rsc615000	odour	the residue	strong		From subsequent trials it appeared , that , when hepatic and pure air were fired in equal bulks , the residue had a strong odour of volatile vitriolic acid , and moreover contained a small proportion of undecomposed hepatic air .
rsc615000	odour	the residue	strong		From subsequent trials it appeared , that , when hepatic and pure air were fired in equal bulks , the residue had a strong odour of volatile vitriolic acid , and moreover contained a small proportion of undecomposed hepatic air .
rsc615000	odour	of the volatile vitriolic acid			Agreeable to this conclusion , I have found that the odour of the volatile vitriolic acid constantly accompanies the combustion of hepatic with common air in open vessels ; and that when concentrated nitrous acid is added to water impregnated with hepatic air , the filtered liquor becomes turbid upon the addition of muriated barytes .
rsc615000	odour		very fetid		The substance , thus obtained , had a very fetid odour : it appeared to have a near resemblance to an animal oil which had become green by putrefaction .
rsc615000	smell		fetid		At the end of three days a few bubbles of air had appeared at the bottom of the phial ; the water had acquired a light brown colour , and emitted a fetid smell .
rsc615000	smell		highly fetid		The water , by the dissolution of a part of the veal , had now acquired the consistence of a thin mucus , its brown colour was somewhat deepened , and it emitted a highly fetid smell .
rsc615000	smell		fetid		Lime - water , mixed with another portion of it , occasioned an ash - coloured precipitate ; and when concentrated nitrous acid was added to a third portion , the fetid smell was destroyed , a slight effervescence took place , and a yellow flaky matter was disengaged .

rsc615000	smelled		a little putrid		At the end of three days the piece that was in contact with the common air had not altered its colour or consistence , but smelled a little putrid .
rsc615000	odour				The aerial fluid which was disengaged in the foregoing trials from the matter of cancer , by the vitriolic acid , appeared from its odour to have a nearer resemblance to hepatic than to any other species of air .
rsc615000	odour		fetid		The air in which it was placed now occasioned a copious precipitation in limewater , and the brown liquid was found to be impregnated with animal hepatic and fixed air ; the existence of the latter being known by means of lime - water , and that of the former by its occasioning a dark precipitate in a solution of nitrated silver , as well as by its fetid odour , which was increased by the vitriolic , and destroyed by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids .
rsc615000	odour	of animal hepatic air	fetid		I have found , that the fetid odour of animal hepatic air is destroyed by mixing it with pure air , and suffering it to remain in contact with that fluid for several weeks .

rsc615000	odour	of inflammable air			When it was placed in this situation , it acquired an odour which was not exactly similar to any that I had ever before perceived , but which bore some resemblance to that of inflammable air obtained by dissolving iron in spirit of vitriol .
rsc615000	smell	of animal hepatic air	peculiar		The peculiar smell of animal hepatic air is likewise destroyed by agitating it with vinegar , or with the concentrated vitriolic acid .
rsc615000	smell	of animal hepatic air	peculiar		The peculiar smell of animal hepatic air is likewise destroyed by agitating it with vinegar , or with the concentrated vitriolic acid .
rsc615000	effluvia	of putrid animal substances			To the same cause it is probably owing , that polished metallic vessels are quickly tarnished , when they are exposed to the effluvia of putrid animal substances .
rsc615000	smell|odour		much fainter		It has a smell resembling that of rotten eggs ; it is inflammable , and during its combustion in the open air , sulphur is deposited ; it communicates a black colour to silver and copper , and a brownish tinge to lead and iron ; it is soluble in water , and when a solution of nitrated silver is dropped into water impregnated with it , the mixture becomes turbid , and a darkcoloured precipitate falls to the bottom ; by the addition of the nitrated silver , the odour of the hepatic air is rendered much fainter ; and it is entirely destroyed by concentrated nitrous , or by dephlogisticated marine acid .
rsc615000	smell	ammonia	putrid		The experiments recited above appear to prove , that the hepatised ammonia is the ingredient which communicates to the cancerous matter its putrid smell , its greater thinness , and , in a word , all the peculiar properties by which it differs from healthy pus .

rsc615000	fetor	of the animal hepatic air			From these considerations it was inferred , that a medicine which would decompose the hepatised ammonia , and destroy the fetor of the animal hepatic air , without at the same time increasing the morbid action of the vessels , would be productive of salutary effects .
rsc615000	fetor	of hepatic air			The nitrous acid does not destroy the fetor of hepatic air , unless it be highly concentrated ; and in this state it is well known that it speedily corrodes animal substances .
rsc615000	fetor	of hepatic air			But the fetor of hepatic air quickly disappears when it is mixed with the dephlogisticated marine acid , even though the latter be so much diluted with water as to render it a very mild application .
rsc615000	smell	acid			The dephlogisticated marine acid , as is generally known , has the power of destroying the colour , the smell , and perhaps the taste , of the greater part of animal and vegetable substances .
rsc615000	fetor	of putrid flesh			We have seen that it corrects the fetor of putrid flesh .
rsc615000	smell	of a similar mixture of cancerous matter|of distilled water	fetid|much fainter		The fetid smell was now rendered much fainter than that of a similar mixture of cancerous matter , and of distilled water , to which nitrated silver had not been added .
rsc615000	smell	of a similar mixture of cancerous matter|of distilled water	fetid|much fainter		The fetid smell was now rendered much fainter than that of a similar mixture of cancerous matter , and of distilled water , to which nitrated silver had not been added .
rsc615000	smell		fetid		When a little concentrated nitrous acid was dropped into the mixture which had been thus altered by the addition of nitrated silver , a slight effervescence took place , the brown hue was instantly changed to an orange colour , and the fetid smell was abolished .
rsc615000	fetor	marine|matter			The fetor was likewise entirely destroyed , when dephlogisticated marine acid was added either to cancerous matter in its separate state , or to a portion of that substance which had been previously mixed with nitrated silver .
rsc615000	impregnated|odour	of the cancerous matter			The water contained in the phial was now found to be strongly impregnated with the odour of the cancerous matter , and a little nitrated silver being dropped into it , a purplish cloud , inclining to red , was produced .
rsc615000	odour	air|of cancerous matter			If heat be applied , a larger portion of fetid air , having the odour of cancerous matter , may be disengaged ; but in that case it will be found to be mixed with vitriolic acid air .
rsc615000	smell		very fetid		This air , when it was first disengaged , rose in the form of white bubbles ; it had a very fetid smell , similar to that of the cancerous matter ; and the water which was impregnated with it occasioned a dark - brown precipitate in a solution of nitrated silver .
rsc615000	odour		very offensive white		The crooked tube being separated from the proof , a very offensive white vapour , resembling in its odour the air extricated during the experiment , arose from the mixture , and continued to ascend for nearly half an hour .
rsc615000	smell		fetid		When to a portion of this smoking liquor , previously filtered , a little concentrated nitrous acid was added , the fetid smell was entirely destroyed , a slight effervescence took place , and a flaky substance that floated through the mixture was disengaged .
rsc615000	odour	marine acids	fetid		The foregoing experiments prove , in general , that the fetid odour of the matter of cancer is increased by the vitriolic , but entirely destroyed by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids ; that the aerial fluid , which is disengaged by the vitriolic acid , is soluble in water ; and that the solution tion deposits a reddish brown precipitate upon the addition of nitrated silver .

rsc615000	smell	of the cancerous matter			Of the truth of this fact I was persuaded by observing , that the smell of the cancerous matter was greatly increased by the addition of the vitriolic acid : for I could scarcely avoid concluding , that this phenomenon arose from an union between the acid and alkali , in consequence of which the odoriferous principle was extricated by a superior attraction .

rsc65373	emanation|emanation				There are two possible explanations for the results obtained by these authors : \ mdash ; ( 1 ) The one advanced by them to the effect that the - particle is not identical with the helium atom , but that the """" """" radation \ ldquo ; of the large molecule of the emanation is effected by bombardment with - particles , the products of the degradation varying accordin ( } to whether , on the one hand , the emanation is alone or mixed with other gases , or , on the other , wheGher it is dissolved in water or copper sulphate solution .
rsc65373	emanation|emanation				( 2 ) The - particle is a helium atom under ordinary conditions , but when the emanation is dissolved in water or copper sulphate solution an - particle of greater mass is split off from the emanation atom .

rsc610409	Scent	Flower			Honourable Gentlemen , I Now take the Liberty of communicating to you these my following Observations - A certain ancient Surgeon , that is a great Collector of Foreign Curiosities , had entreated another Surgeon , for whom he had an esteem , that when he was in the East Indies , and discovered in the Plants or Seeds of those Parts any particular operation or effect , that he would impart some of ' em to him , with an account of their said operation ; whereupon he had received from the East Indies the Seed of a Tree called Euwane , of which the Description and Operation is as follows - ' Tis a Tree much about the bigness of an Elder Tree , and the Flower , the Scent and Figure of it is not very different , but the Branches are armed with Thorns - ' Tis used inwardly by no body , excepting some Women , that , disagreeing with their Husbands , make use of it in order to kill themselves ; it being consequently a certain Poison When these Women have made such a Heathenish and Impious Resolution , they take half a handful of those Leaves , boiling them in Water , and rubbing in a certain Oil which they call Sinselen , and so drink or eat it up ; half an hour after which they perceive a kind of Convulsion in their Head , and vomit or retch four or five times : Lastly , they lose their Senses , and foaming at the Mouth , they fret and speak like Fools or Mad men till they dye : So that it seems that the Poison thickens the Humours or fluid parts of the Body , till the circulation of them quite ceases .
rsc617260	Stench	of Water			These bad Effects , in different Degrees , according to the different Manner in which Air is enclosed , are observed in many Cases ; particularly in deep Wells and Caverns of the Earth , in Prisons or close Houses , where People are shut up with Heat and Nastiness : But most of all in large Ships , in which , with the Stench of Water in the Hold , many Men being crouded up in Close .
rsc617260	Effluvia	from the	noxious		When any Part of it is enclosed and kept from the Communication of the outward Air , it expands itself , and , in Proportion to the Closeness of the Place , loses its Spring ; and if any Heat or Moisture comes to it , the elastic Force may be quite lost and destroyed : And not only so , but if it happens to be impregnated with noxious Effluvia , either from unwholesome Substances of any kind , or from the infectious Breath of diseased Bodies ; it will become quite poisonous and deadly , in a manner suitable to the original Cause .

rsc610542	Effluvia|Effluvia		fresh		I ought to tell you , that when I had , by several Trials , found out about what time the Effluvia would be quite dissipated , I forbore making any Trials till then , lest that , by bringing the Tube or Cane near the Body of Trial , I might communicate fresh Effluvia , and perpetuate the State of Repulsion longer than it would otherwise have been ; so that , in the last Trials I made , I never came near with the Tube , & amp ; c , till full twenty Minutes after the Body of Trial was put into a State of Repulsion .
rsc610542	Effluvia|Effluvia	the glass Tube	the most lasting		I observed not any material Difference of Time between the Dissipation of the Effluvia of the glass Tube , and those of the Wax Cane , when the same Body of Trial was made use of for both : If there was any Difference , I think the vitreous Effluvia were the most lasting .
rsc610542	Effluvia|Effluvia	the glass Tube	the most lasting		I observed not any material Difference of Time between the Dissipation of the Effluvia of the glass Tube , and those of the Wax Cane , when the same Body of Trial was made use of for both : If there was any Difference , I think the vitreous Effluvia were the most lasting .
rsc610542	Effluvia|those|Effluvia	from the wax Cane	grosser|luminous		I made another Trial with the Cane and Tube in a dark Room ; being led to it from a Suspicion I had , that the Effluvia from the wax Cane were grosser , and more in Quantity , than those from the glass Tube ; and , upon exciting both as quick as I could in Succession , I found the luminous Effluvia , when I brought my Forefinger near the Wax , to proceed in a much greater Quantity to the Cane from the Tip of Finger , than they did on the same Trial with the Tube of Glass .
rsc610542	Effluvia|those|Effluvia	from the wax Cane	grosser|luminous		I made another Trial with the Cane and Tube in a dark Room ; being led to it from a Suspicion I had , that the Effluvia from the wax Cane were grosser , and more in Quantity , than those from the glass Tube ; and , upon exciting both as quick as I could in Succession , I found the luminous Effluvia , when I brought my Forefinger near the Wax , to proceed in a much greater Quantity to the Cane from the Tip of Finger , than they did on the same Trial with the Tube of Glass .
rsc610542	Effluvia		resinous		Another Difference I remarked was , that the resinous Effluvia were more deeply coloured than the vitreous .
rsc610542	Effluvia		resinous|more unctuous|sulphureous		Whether it be not probable , that the resinous Effluvia are more unctuous or sulphureous than the vitreous ; and because not so active and nitrous , less apt to kindle inflammable Spirits , as I think I found them to be ? I entreat I may not be considered as pretending , in the above Trials , to establish Laws , but , as plainly relating Matters of Fact .
rsc610542	Effluvia		different|vitreous|resinous		I did not intend this should extend to that Experiment , which proves the different Nature of vitreous and resinous Effluvia ; which , I presume , may be considered as invariable inherent Properties ; so that Bodies , put into a State of Repulsion by the one , will be attracted by the other , & amp ; c .
rsc6540	Effluvia|Effluvia				Wheler had tried the same thing with his Servant ; from whence it is reasonable to conclude , that it is necessary , that the same Person who excited the Cake should likewise hold the Thread ; as if there were some Analogy between the Effluvia excited by the clapping of the Hand on the Cake , and the Effluvia which may be communicated along from the Hand which holds the Thread to the Piece of Cork at the End of it .
rsc6548	Effluvia|Effluvia		electric|electric		But though upon the Whole it does at last appear , that this Motion from West to East in a pendulous Body , applied to another in the Centre of an electric Area , is to be ascribed to the Hand that holds it , and not solely to the Nature of the electric Effluvia , or the Figure of the central Body ; yet still , perhaps , it may not be improper for Astronomers to consider , whether or no a Medium with this Property , that all Bodies immersed in it , are repulsive of one another , ought not to be joined with Gravity to explain the heavenly Phenomenon ; especially since the Phenomenon of Fire , and our electric Effluvia , have a great Affinity to each other ; and since many of the heavenly Phenomenon are to be accounted for , upon this Supposition , with great Simplicity ; and some of them , that have not yet perhaps been fully accounted for , seem necessarily to follow .

rsc616525	impregnation|impregnation	in diluted water			As the values are not very consistent , it is not possible to come to very definite conclusions as to the effects produced , but it will be seen that , as a rule , impregnation in diluted water exerts a harmful effect , whilst impregnation in concentrated water exerts a beneficial effect upon the subsequent development .
rsc616525	impregnated	uric acid			As these mean variations produced in the size of larvae impregnated in uric acid and pievious fertilisation water are small enough to be within the limits of experimental error , it must be considered as probable that the protoplasm of the ovum and spermatozoon , ON THE DEVELOPMENT OP ECHINODERM LARVAE .

rsc616525	impregnating	diluted water			In the five observations made on the effect of impregnating the ova in diluted water , the corrected aboral and oral arm lengths are about 5 per cent , greater than the normal , but , as the numbers vary considerably in the different experiments , nothing definite can be concluded .
rsc616525	impregnation	of the ova in concentrated water			This increase is too large to be due to experimental error , so we must conclude that impregnation of the ova in concentrated water causes a slight increase in the body length of the larvae and a considerable increase in their arm length .

rsc611200	efflorescence		saline		ALTHOUGH the following observations afford no positive evidence of the source of that saline efflorescence , which is so frequently seen on the walls of subterraneous and other buildings , and which , as consisting principally if not entirely of common nitre , long since .
rsc611200	effluvia	saltpetre|nitre|animal|vegetable			There can be no doubt that the production of saltpetre or nitre , in the situations above alluded to , had been observed long before there existed any general inducement to collect it from those sources ; but after the invention and subsequent extensive employment of gunpowder , it became an object not only to search out every natural source of the principal ingredient of that important compound , but also to investigate the circumstances of its production ; for the purpose either of accelerating the natural process , or of imitating it by artificial means , The usual and almost exclusive occurrence of saltpetre on walls constructed of limestone , and in situations exposed to animal and vegetable effluvia , in all probability led to the empirical practice of heaping together the mortar and refuse of old buildings with putrescent animal and vegetable matter ; from a mixture of which kind , after exposure for a sufficient length of time to the action of the air , a quantity of nitre may usually be obtained by lixiviation : but it would be a question of mere curiosity , on this occasion at least , to investigate the origin of the practice .

rsc611087	effluvia		electrified		Electrical matter , according to our author , differs from common matter in this , that the parts of the latter mutually attract , and those of the former mutually repel , each other ; hence the divergency in a stream of electrified effluvia ~ : but that , tho ' the Cc2 particles ~ As the electric stream is observed to diverge very little , when the experiment is made in vacuo , this appearance is more owing particles of electrical matter do repel each other , they are strongly attracted by all other matter .
rsc611087	effluvia|effluvia	of non - electrics			By a very ingenious experiment our author endeavours to evince the impossibility of success , in the experiments proposed by others of drawing forth the effluvia of non - electrics , cinamon , for instance , and by mixing them with the electrical fluid , to convey them with that into a person electrified : and our author thinks , that tho ' the effluvia of cinamon and the electrical fluid should mix within the globe , they would never come out together through the pores of the glass , and thus be conveyed to the prime conductor ; for he thinks , that the electrical fluid itself cannot come through , and that the prime conductor is always supplied from the cushion , and this last from the floor .
rsc611087	effluvia				He has tried another way , which he thought more likely to obtain a mixture of the electrical and other effluvia together , if such a mixture had been possible .
rsc611087	smell	of the electrical effluvia			And as the oil of turpentine being in some degree an electric per se , would not conduct what came up from the floor , the electricity was obliged to jump from the end of one chain to the end of the other , which he could see in large sparks ; and thus it had a fair opportunity of seizing of the finest particles of the oil in its passage , and carrying them off with it : but no such effect followed , nor could he perceive the least difference in the smell of the electrical effluvia thus collected , from what it had when collected otherwise ; nor does it otherwise affect the body of the person electrified .

Will they say , that the Electricity , specifically operating upon their medical Virtue , separates it from their odoriferous Quality ? Miserable Subterfuge ! Which does not merit to be opposed seriously ; and the more so , as it is by the Transfusion of their Odours , that they pretend to be assured of the Efficacy of their lined Tubes .

rsc613345	Stench		insupportable		There was then a New Island , like to the present , which , between the Islands of Santorini , Nio , and Andro , rose up by means of Subterraneous Fires , which caused several violent Earthquakes , accompanied with a roaring Noise under ground , Sulphureous Exhalations , an insupportable Stench , and a black Smoke , which rose out of the Sea with Flames to the height of 10 or 12 Cubits .
rsc613345	Smell		very ill		The Smoke , which issued out of this Ridge of Stones , or Black Island , was very thick and white , as if it had proceeded from 5 or 6 Lime - Kilns joined together ; and being carried by a North Wind towards the Castle of Acrotiri , it went into the Houses of the Inhabitants , but without causing any great annoyance , because it had no very ill Smell .
rsc613345	Stench		so great		The Sea was at that time covered with a Matter or Froath , which in some places was reddish , and in others yellowish ; from whence there proceeded so great a Stench over the whole Island of Santorini , that for fear of being infected , several Persons were obliged to burn incense , and others to make Fires upon the tops of their Houses , to disperse it and to purify the Air .

rsc66721	emanation		radium		It has long been known that the of radiunr inous compounds decreases with lapse of time , and in 1910 Marsden * made measurements of this effict in the case of zinc sulphide , willemite , and platinocyanide acted on by radium emanation .
rsc66721	emanation	radium|radium|radium			Since practically the whole of the luminosity of a radium compound is due to - particles with their recoil atoms , it will be clear that the only products of importance are the radium itself , the emanation , radium , and radium , since these the only products ivin o - particles with ) exception of polonium , the effect of which , in the case of compound made up from freshly prepared radium , will be negligible at least for the first two years , owing to the long half - transformation period of the intermediate product radium D .
rsc66721	emanation|emanation|emanation|emanation				Now for practical purposes it may be assumed that the transformations of , and take place practically simultaneously with the transformation of the emanation , so that in new radium initially free from emanation , the growth of the emanation is accompanied by a rise in - ray activity such as would be caused if each atom of emanation , in its trans - formation , gave rise to three - particles producing , and ions respectively .
rsc66721	emanation		atom		* Hence if , as in Rutherford ' s theory , we suppose that the luminosity produced by an - particle is , other conditions being the same , vely nearly proportional to the number of ions it is capable of producing , we may regard each atom of emanation as responsible for , very approximately , four times the effect of an atom of radium alone which produces ions .

rsc65040	Scent	of the Balsam			Some time before the King went for England , I had frequent Discourse with a certain Physician about the Curing of Shortness of Breath ; who tole me , that he was well acquainted with all the sorts of Balsam that were esteemed useful in that Disease , but that it was impossible to find any Vehicle that could insinuate them effectually into the Lungs , and that in vain do they anoint the Breast and Stomach with Balsams that could never reach the Lungs , and that the Scent of the Balsam which exhaled from those that used to anoint their Breast with Oil , does not exhale from the Pipes of the Lungs , but was evaporated from the Breast by the Neck .

rsc614908	impregnated	nitrous air			The reason of this in all probability is , that as the acid was then corroding the mercury , the soaplees became impregnated with nitrous air , which , during the night , united to the dephlogisticated air , and caused the diminution .

rsc69096	odour				Had not both its odour and its behaviour with soda pointed to benzonitrile , all doubt of the formation of this body would have been removed , when upon addition of hydrochloric acid to the filtered sodic liquid an abundant quantity of the purest benzoic acid was separated , the nature of which was , moreover , fixed by an analysis of the silver - salt .
rsc69317	odour		usual		The percolating liquid appears quite colourless , and devoid of the usual odour of urine .
rsc69317	odour		strongly urinous		The fatty matter which is left undissolved by the water has a dark - brown colour and a strongly urinous odour .
rsc614801	candour		greater		71 actions two years before * , it is not a matter of surprise , that the labours of these very eminent chemical philosophers , did not , in this department , obtain an authority in this country , which an appearance of greater candour would unquestionably have ensured them .
rsc614805	odour		stronger		This view is confirmed by the observed fact of the stronger odour exhaled by the bodies of black people .
rsc614805	smell		almost intolerable		During the earlier part of that winter I generally wore a light olive - coloured dress ; but happening one day to attend the rooms in black clothes , I was not a little struck by the almost intolerable smell they had acquired .
rsc614805	smell		very strong		The smell was so very strong as to be remarked even by the family at home , and it was recognised on the same piece of dress for several days .
rsc614805	odour		to the same extent		No odour to the same extent had been remarked in the lighter - coloured clothes .
rsc614805	smell|odour		fetid|comparatively trifling		The fetid smell which they more or less acquired in the atmosphere of the rooms was comparatively trifling , and slight exposure to the air alone was necessary to deprive them of the odour which they had thus contracted .
rsc614805	smell	particles			When examined six hours afterwards , it was at once evident to the sense of smell that the black wool had attracted more of the odorous particles than the white wool , though neither had gained any appreciable weight .
rsc614805	odour|smell	a piece of assafoetida	strong|scarcely perceptible		I took equal weights of black and white wool , and put them in a small drawer along with a piece of assafoetida ; in twenty - four hours the black wool had contracted a strong odour of the gum , while in the white wool , the smell was scarcely perceptible .
rsc614805	odour|smell	a piece of assafoetida	strong|scarcely perceptible		I took equal weights of black and white wool , and put them in a small drawer along with a piece of assafoetida ; in twenty - four hours the black wool had contracted a strong odour of the gum , while in the white wool , the smell was scarcely perceptible .
rsc614805	emanations	of cainphor			Two similar quantities were at the same time exposed to the emanations of cainphor in another drawer .
rsc614805	smell	particles	the greatest		In both the black - coloured cotton had attracted the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as palpably evidenced by the smell .
rsc614805	smell	particles	the greatest		In both the black - coloured cotton had attracted the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as palpably evidenced by the smell .
rsc614805	smell|smell|odour	particles	the greatest		The black in both experiments had attracted by far the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as evidenced to smell ; the red next followed in point of intensity of smell ; and the white , so far as could be judged , had attracted least of the odour .
rsc614805	smell|smell|odour	particles	the greatest		The black in both experiments had attracted by far the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as evidenced to smell ; the red next followed in point of intensity of smell ; and the white , so far as could be judged , had attracted least of the odour .
rsc614805	odour		the same ratio		Circumstances prevented me from resuming these investigations till the summer of 1832 , when I repeated the experiments with a greater variety of coloured substances , in wool , cotton , and silk , and satisfied not only myself but many of my friends , that odour was attracted nearly in the same ratio as caloric , by coloured substances .
rsc614805	smell|smell	of assafoetida|the yellow	the strongest|little		The black was found to have much the strongest smell of assafoetida ; the blue the next ; after that the red , and then the green ; the yellow had but little smell , and the white scarcely any .
rsc614805	smell|smell	of assafoetida|the yellow	the strongest|little		The black was found to have much the strongest smell of assafoetida ; the blue the next ; after that the red , and then the green ; the yellow had but little smell , and the white scarcely any .
rsc614805	smell		of corresponding intensity		In all these the smell was invariably found to be of corresponding intensity , according to the colour , as in the wools .
rsc614805	smell|odorous|odour	particles	stronger|very feeble		After twenty - four hours , the black wool had acquired a stronger smell than the cotton of similar colour ; the white wool had also taken up more of the odorous particles than the white cotton , though the odour in both was very feeble .
rsc614805	smell|odorous|odour	particles	stronger|very feeble		After twenty - four hours , the black wool had acquired a stronger smell than the cotton of similar colour ; the white wool had also taken up more of the odorous particles than the white cotton , though the odour in both was very feeble .
rsc614805	odour|smell|odour		much more distinguishable|much more		When assafoetida was used in a similar experiment , the odour was much more distinguishable , and it could at once be distinguished by smell , that the wool had taken up much more of the odour than the cotton .
rsc614805	odours		fetid		Indeed , from many experiments I have made to ascertain this fact , wool appears to have a peculiar attraction for fetid odours .
rsc614805	exhales|odour|smell|smell	of sulphuretted hydrogen|of the sulphuret	copiously|fetid|camphorous|in considerable intensity|fetid		For instance , if , after having allowed wool to lie in contact with camphor for some time , it be afterwards placed , even for a very few hours , near a minute portion of sulphuret of barium ( which , it is wMell known , exhales copiously the fetid odour of sulphuretted hydrogen , ) it quickly loses the camphorous smell , and acquires and even retains in considerable intensity the fetid smell of the sulphuret .
rsc614805	exhales|odour|smell|smell	of sulphuretted hydrogen|of the sulphuret	copiously|fetid|camphorous|in considerable intensity|fetid		For instance , if , after having allowed wool to lie in contact with camphor for some time , it be afterwards placed , even for a very few hours , near a minute portion of sulphuret of barium ( which , it is wMell known , exhales copiously the fetid odour of sulphuretted hydrogen , ) it quickly loses the camphorous smell , and acquires and even retains in considerable intensity the fetid smell of the sulphuret .
rsc614805	odour	substances	the different intensities		All the members of the family , and several of my friends , have lent their aid to distinguish between the different intensities of the odour which each substance had attracted ; and though only a few experiments are here detailed , similar ones have been many times performed , with various other odorous substances .
rsc614805	odour	substances	the different intensities		All the members of the family , and several of my friends , have lent their aid to distinguish between the different intensities of the odour which each substance had attracted ; and though only a few experiments are here detailed , similar ones have been many times performed , with various other odorous substances .
rsc614805	odour	substance|substances|whose	inseparable from the substance		I was therefore desirous , that , if possible , at least one experiment should be devised , which would show , by the evidence of actual increase of weight , that one colour invariably attracted more of any odorous substance than another ; and upon considering the various odorous substances which could be easily volatilized without change , and whose odour was inseparable from the substance , I fixed upon camphor as the one best suited to my purpose .

rsc614805	odours|smell				The deposition of the camphor in various proportions on the coloured substances submitted to experiment , offered evidence of the particular attraction of colours for odours , resting on ocular demonstration ; and when to this is added the evidence arising from a positive increase of weight , as ascertained by the balance , the conclusions previously drawn from the sense of smell are confirmed in a singular and very satisfactory manner .
rsc614805	smell		little		In another , where the heat was applied for about ten seconds , the white had gained no appreciable weight , and but little smell ; the red had gained - .
rsc614805	odours	silk			From this experiment it would appear that of these two animal substances , silk possesses the greatest attraction for odours .
rsc614805	odours	animal substances			The general conclusion would appear to be , that animal substances have a greater attraction for odours than vegetable matters ; and that all these have their power much increased by their greater darkness or intensity of colour .
rsc614805	smell		different intensities		Though one can easily judge by the sense 307 of smell alone the different intensities which these articles have acquired immediately on being taken out of the drawer , yet , after exposure for some time to the air , the difference of intensity is much more difficult to be perceived .
rsc614805	odour	substances|particles	sensible		In general it seemed to me , that the whole of the substances lost their sensible odour in nearly the same space of time , though the odorous particles given out by the black were of course much greater in quantity than in the others .

rsc614805	emanations		odorous		If it be thus certain that odorous emanations have not only a particular affinity for different substances , but that the colour of those substances materially affects their absorbing or radiating quality ; the knowledge of these facts may afford useful hints for the preservation of the general health during the prevalence of contagious or epidemic diseases .
rsc614805	exhalations|effluvia|smell		latent poisonous		From their minute division and vast range of action , latent poisonous exhalations or effluvia , inappreciable by the balance , may , no doubt , exist to dangerous extent without being evident to the sense of smell .
rsc614805	emanations	from the sick			But in most cases it will be found , that , when contagious diseases prevail to such extent , the emanations from the sick will , if attended to , give the surest indications of the contamination of the surrounding air .
rsc614805	effluvia		animal		As to fumigation with chlorine , it cannot be denied that this will destroy the animal effluvia floating in the air exposed to its action .
rsc614805	odour|smell				It merely absorbs the gases which disguise the odour , but neither changes its deleterious properties nor alters its real smell .
rsc614805	effluvia		hurtful		In such cases I should trust more to white - washing the walls , personal cleanliness , and free ventilation , for destroying or dimninishing the effects of supposed pestilential or hurtful effluvia , than to any other measures .
rsc614805	effluvia		animal		Acid and other fumigations , except chlorine , only disguise , but do not destroy the property of animal effluvia to produce disease .
rsc614805	emanations|emanations		deleterious|fresh		The fumigations in this case could only act upon the deleterious emanations in the air at the time ; but unless constantly renewed could not affect the fresh emanations generated from those labouring under the disease .
rsc614805	effluvium|emanations				The white - washing , on the other hand , although it had no specific action on the contagious effluvium , yet , by constantly presenting a reflecting sulface , prevented the absorption of the emanations by the walls , and thus tended , with moderate ventilation , to keep the air of the apartments pure .
rsc614805	odoiurs		noxious		Dirty dark - coloured walls , on the contrary , would readily , as has been demonstrated , absorb noxious odoiurs , and as soon as the effect of the fumigation was over , gradually give them out again .
rsc614805	emanations		deleterious		The whiteness of the walls prevented them from absorbing the deleterious emanations , and the currents of air were thus enabled to sweep them away , before they had accumulated to such a degree as to become an active source of disease .
rsc614805	effluvia		infectious		Facts have been mentioned which make it next to certain , that contagious disease may be communicated to a third person through the mediumn of one who has been exposed to contagion , but himself not affected * ; and indeed the circumstance of infectious effluvia being capable of being carried by medical men from one patient to another , I should conceive one of the means by which such diseases are often propagated , in the ill - ventilated and dirty habitations of the poor exposed to their influence .
rsc614805	emanations	of fever patients	hurtful		Even in my own very limited experience I think I have observed some melancholy instances of the effect of black dress in absorbing the hurtful emanations of fever patients in a public hospital ; and many facts are incidentally related by medical writers , and referred to other causes , which I should not hesitate to ascribe chiefly to exposure of this nature .

rsc614805	smell	of the gaol			"""" ' Lord BACON attributes this effect to the """" smell of the gaol , where the prisoners have been close and nastily kept , """" and mentions it having occurred twice or thrice in his time , when both the judges that sat upon the trial , and numbers of those who attended the business , or were present , sickened or died + .
rsc614805	emanations|effluvium|odours		putrid|baneful		My explanation of the peculiar fatality of these emanations to the judges , counsel , and jurors , was the attraction of their official black for the putrid effluvium , as Sir JOHN calls it ; and the escape of two of the judges who sat on one side of the LORD MAYOR , to the current of air in the room not sending the baneful odours in their direction .
rsc614807	effict emanating				) T HE nature of the heating effict emanating from luminous hot bodies has been distinctly shown to be , in many particulars , very different from that evolved from non - luminous sources ; but the ideas commonly entertained on the subject , are far from being precise and distinct .
rsc613254	splendour		sufficient		The great varieties of structure which may exist among comets , as well as the remarkable changes which the same comet undergoes at different epochs , will cause all those who are interested in the advance of our knowledge of the cosmical relations of these bodies , and of the gaseous nebulae , to wait with some impatience the visit of a comet of sufficient splendour to permit a satisfactory prismatic examination of the physical state of cometary matter during the various changes which are dependent upon the perihelion passage of the comet .

rsc613256	aroma	fruit			It would follow from these observations , that with the aid of stoves and electric light , fruit , excelling both in sweetness and aroma , and flowers of great brightness , may be grown without solar aid .
rsc613190	emanation	gas			Rutherford and I have made special experiments to test whether xenon was present with our preparations of emanation , but could not detect any trace of this gas .
rsc613190	emanation	radium			Cameron and Ramsay attribute a line at 4058 ' 5 to the active deposit of the radium emanation , since its relative intensity increases with the length of time that the discharge has passed .
rsc613190	emanation		radium		Collie * gave a list of lines produced by the discharge in a vacuum tube containing radium emanation , but the uncertainty of these numbers made a redetermination desirable .
rsc613190	emanation|emanation				Rutherford had completed the measurements of the volume of the radium emanation , he and the writer were able to photograph the spectrum that had been observed in the course of this work , and we published in ' Nature , ' July 9 , 1908 , the wave - lengths of the stronger lines observed by us in the emanation spectrum , and a more complete list , containing 73 lines , with an accuracy of 0 ' 5 A .
rsc613190	emanation|emanation		pure		The complete purification of the radium emanation demands a lengthy and painstaking procedure , and is a matter of considerable difficulty , for the volume of pure emanation available in our experiments would occupy at * ' Hoy .
rsc613190	emanation		pure		Rutherford , * a complete day ' s work was taken up before the vacuum tube was filled with the pure emanation .
rsc613190	emanation	radium			We have observed the spectrum of the radium emanation at least eight times , and have obtained almost exactly the same spectrum on each occasion .
rsc613190	emanation		radium		! An examination of the accompanying table shows that the spectrum attributed by them to the radium emanation is mainly a compound of the xenon spectra obtained with and without Leyden jar , the jar spectrum having been brought out , probably , * ' Phil .
rsc613190	emanation|emanation	xenon lines			Taking into account the complete list of Ramsay and Cameron ' s lines , including those printed in italics , which were seen only in previous photographs , the number of emanation lines amounts to 16 ; there are , of course , numerous coincidences within the accuracy of their measurements , of xenon lines with possible emanation lines .
rsc613192	smell		offensive sulphurous		"""" The specimens of the bottom about Kerguelen were all from depths from 120 to 20 fathoms , and consisted usually of dark mud , with an offensive sulphurous smell .
rsc616821	emanation	uranium			of air over a film of 0 - 0012 gramme per square centimetre is produced by the a - particles * ; the range of its a - particle was believed to be short , which meant smaller total voltages would be required to obtain a saturation current ; and finally uranium has no emanation , the cause of experimental difficulties with radium .

rsc65285	emanation		millicuries		The source used at the commencement of the experiments was about 300 millicuries of emanation .
rsc65285	emanation		radium		The microscope used had a nification of about The source of radium emanation was contained in two sealed glass tubes , , which could be attached by means of string to one end of an iron rod .
rsc616552	emanations	the same substances	feebler		The luminous gas would almost certainly emit light of the same refrangibility as some of the dark lines of the solar spectrum ; and if there existed above the spot the vapours of the same substances in a cooler state , the light might be wholly absorbed , and the feebler emanations of the still luminous but cooler vapours might not do more than render somewhat less intense the dark gaps produced by the vapours in the stronger light of all refrangibilities which is evidently present .

rsc64486	emanation|emanation	radium			) The results obtained by Ramsay and Cameron * on dissolving radium emanation in water and in copper sulphate solution have made it advisable to investigate the behaviour of the emanation , when dissolved in such solvents , from a radio - active standpoint .
rsc64486	emanation|emanation				There are two possible explanations for the results obtained by these authors : \ # 151 ; ( 1 ) The one advanced by them to the effect that the a - particle is not identical with the helium atom , but that the """" degradation """" of the large molecule of the emanation is effected by bombardment with a - particles , the products of the degradation varying according to whether , on the one hand , the emanation is alone or mixed with other gases , or , on the other , whether it is dissolved in water or copper sulphate solution .
rsc64486	emanation|emanation				( 2 ) The a - particle is a helium atom under ordinary conditions , but when the emanation is dissolved in water or copper sulphate solution an a - particle of greater mass is split off from the emanation atom .
rsc64486	emanation|emanation				If the latter explanation be correct the disintegration products of the emanation when it is dissolved in water or copper sulphate solution ought to be different from those obtained from the emanation when alone or mixed with air .
rsc64486	emanation	radium			The present note deals with the rate of decay of the radium emanation when dissolved in water .
rsc64486	emanation	radium bromide			The emanation accumulated by 110 milligrammes of radium bromide in two days , with the accompanying oxygen and hydrogen , was collected in a gas burette over mercury .
rsc64486	emanation|emanation				As the volume of the emanation used was less than OT30 cubic millimetre and the solubility coefficient at 18 ' , as obtained by Kofler , * is 0 ' 270 , the ratio of the volume of the emanation in the gas phase to that in the water phase would be small .
rsc64486	emanation|emanation				The degradation of a portion of the emanation molecules into neon or argon atoms instead of helium atoms , would not necessarily change the time rate of decay ; on the other hand , the percentage of the emanation atoms which changed per second might be the same although the mass of the a - particle varied .

rsc612879	impregnated	acid			The serum having been allowed to separate , and a little nitric acid having been added to it , not the least vestige of prussic acid appeared in applying the test of sulphat of iron , although the urine made during the six hours which preceded and followed the cupping , was strongly impregnated with that acid , and struck a vivid blue upon adding the smallest quantity of iron .
rsc612879	impregnated	urine			Upon trial of this salt , I found that a solution of it might be taken without the least inconvenience , and that in less than one hour and a half the urine became perceptibly impregnated , and continued so to the fifth or sixth hour , although the quantity taken had not amounted to more than three grains of the salt .
rsc617080	smell		peculiar		To ascertain if there was any peculiar smell belonging to the eruption , we passed a little within the skirts of the cloud , and the wind then freshening , we found ourselves in the midst of a dark shower of ashes , which fell with the force of fine hail , covered our persons , and almost blinded us .

rsc67172	emanation	of particles of light from lucid substances			Ever since the publication of Sir ISAAC NEWTON ' S incomparable writings , his doctrines of the emanation of particles of light from lucid substances , and of the formal pre - existence of coloured rays in white light , have been almost universally admitted in this country , and but little opposed in others .
rsc67172	emanation		partial		For explaining the phenomenon of partial and total reflection , refraction , and inflection , nothing more is necessary than to suppose all refracting media to retain , by their attraction , a greater or less quantity of the luminous ether , so as to make its density greater than that which it possesses in a vacuum , without increasing its elasticity ; and that light is a propagation of an impulse communicated to this ether by luminous bodies : whether this impulse is produced by a partial emanation of the ether , or by vibrations of the particles of the body , and whether these vibrations are , as EULER supposed , of various and irregular magnitudes , or whether they are uniform , and comparatively large , remains to be hereafter determined .

rsc69184	smell	of Senna			The Samples that he sent were not in sufficient quantity to make experiment on the Distempers , he said , it was proper for ; but there was enough to try whether they had the virtue to correct the taste and smell of Senna .
rsc69184	smell	ofSenna			There was likewise tried the Virtue of our Scrophularia , and it was found to have the same effect , in taking away the taste and smell ofSenna .
rsc69186	impregnation		weak		In some cases , indeed , where the spring was one of weak impregnation , I have carried the concentration much further , as may be seen in the Llandrindod waters , where no traces of iodine appeared , until they had been reduced to nearly one - 50th of their original volume .
rsc69186	impregnation	of sulphuretted hydrogen			At both places are waters which differ from the rest in containing an unimportant impregnation of sulphuretted hydrogen , but in other respects correspond .
rsc69186	impregnation		weaker		In this instance , also , I have adopted the statements of another , merely making a proportionate deduction from the amount of the ingredients given by that able chemist , in consequence of the weaker impregnation of the samples of water I employed , than of those on which he appears to have operated .
rsc69186	impregnation		saline		It may be remarked , however , that the rocksalt of Northwich in Cheshire contains no trace of either principle ; a circumstance explicable from the more deliquescent nature of the hydriodic and hydrobromic salts , which would cause them , together with the earthy muriates , to remain in the mother - liquor after the common salt had crystallized , and thus to become distributed through the substance of the marly beds afterwards formed over the rock - salt , from which the brine - springs appear to derive their saline impregnation .
rsc69186	impregnated	purgative salts			These two springs , which at present appear almost identical , are the ones most strongly impregnated with purgative salts , and therefore approximate more nearly to the character of that analysed by Mr .

rsc614954	smell|smell	gross oil			All plants , thus fermented , yielded plentifully ( especially toward the latter end of the distillation , ) a faetid gross oil , which , if the herb was well putrified , did not in the least resemble the plant which produced it ; and I could hardly perceive , that they differed from each other in either taste or smell : only , if the plant was not thoroughly fermented , an Oil would come over at the beginning of the distillation , which , as also the water , would retain exactly the taste and smell of the vegetable , which afforded it ; and it would be fluid and transparent , like other Essential oils .
rsc614954	odour		very odd|faint|fetid|offensive		The Oil of herbs very well putrified came over chiefly at last , and did require a very strong fire to extricate it out of the herb ; was mostly , especially that which comes last of all , of the colour and consistence of Tar , very tenacious , and did far and wide emit a very odd , faint , fetid , offensive odour : If any thing became infected by this oil , it was not to be freed from it in a long time .
rsc614954	stink	those Flowers			None of those Flowers , I have hitherto used , do stink in fermentation .

rsc613264	odour	of the sulphureous			At this period , scarcely any stjlphureous acid was evolved , but in about one hour the liquid became blackish - brown ; much sulphureous acid gas was then produced , and continued to increase during four hours , when the whole appeared like a thick black liquid , at which period not any odour or , appearance of camphor could be perceived , but only that of the sulphureous acid .
rsc613264	odour	of sulphureous gas			brown , a considerable coagulum of the same colour subsided , the odour of sulphureous gas , .
rsc613264	impregnated|odour				The whole was then subjected to gradual distillation , during which , the water came over strongly impregnated with the odour abovementioned , accompanied by a yellowish .
rsc613264	odour	of it			I then added two ounces of water , which I drew off by distillation , but did not obtain any of the vegetable essential oil which has been mentioned , nor did the odour of it return , I therefore continued the distillation until a dry blackish brown mass remained this was well washed with warm distilled water , by which , however , nothing was extracted ; but when two ounces of alcohol were digested on it during twenty - four hours , a very dark brown tincture was formed .
rsc613264	odour	of caromel	slight		The different portions of the solution formed by alcohol were added together , and being distilled by means of a waterbath , a blackish brown substance was obtained , which had the appearance of a resin or gum with a slight odour of caromel , and weighed 49 grains .

rsc64639	odour		perceptible		The compound of this gas and ammonia was a perfect neutral salt , neither changing the colour of turmeric or litmus ; it had no perceptible odour , but a pungent saline taste ; it was deliquescent , and of course very soluble in water ; it was decomposed by the sulphuric , nitric , and phosphoric acids , and also by liquid muriatic acid ; but it sublimed unaltered in the muriatic , carbonic , and sulphureous acid gasses , and dissolvedt without effervescing in acetic acid .

rsc64639	smell		intolerable		The liquor thus impregnated was thrown into water , and a pretty appearance was produced by the sudden escape of bubbles of the gas ; had not its intolerable smell convinced me that the gas was unaltered , I should not have conceived that it could pass through water undecomposed .

rsc63050	smell		sulphureous		But though the death of the man and of the horses might ( by some ) be attributed to this cause , the sulphureous smell will no wise account for ` ` many pieces of the coal having been thrown out , to a considerable distance , all round the cart ; ' ' and for the ` ` splinters ' ' ( from the wood - work of the cart ) that were ` ` thrown off in many places , ' ' as appears , by Mr .

rsc63054	smell				This substance being separated from the acid , and washed with cold water , presented the following characters : it was colourless ; its smell resembled both that of muriated sulphur and of oxyd of osmium ; its taste was both acrid and acid ; it was very volatile , melted at a gentle heat , and sublimed without residue .
rsc63054	smell				From this solution , a spirituous liquor is obtained by distillation , which possesses the same smell , and leaves a residue of muriate and sulphate of zinc .
rsc63054	smell	of sublphureous acid			Sulphuric acid , however , produces a slight effervescence , and the liquor exhales a smell of sublphureous acid .
rsc63054	smell		nauseous|fetid|differing from		It has an acrid , pungent , and somewhat aromatic taste ; its smell is nauseous and fetid , though distinctly differing from that of sulphuretted hydrogen .
rsc63054	odour|impregnating				The alcohol of sulphur is not soluble in water , though it imparts to it some of its odour ; this appears to be owing to its impregnating the atmospheric air contained in the water , rather than the water itself .
rsc63059	effccts		startlingly great		The soft - iron wire experimented on on the of December gave , with hanging on it , smaller effects of successive ' makes in one direction , and breaks of the current ; a greater effect when it was made in the reverse ection ; and a smaller sum added January \ mdash ; Nearly six months I asccrtained that these startlingly great effccts actually were due to the vertical component earth ' s force , this was only about - u5 tizing force of the currcnts used .

rsc615214	odour		sulphureous		Common salt , however , is never found in coal - mines , except when they are in the vicinity of salt - springs ; whilst , on the contrary , pyrites , sulphate of iron , and alum , are commonly found in such mines ; from which circumstances , together with the sulphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral coals when burned , the agency of sulphuric acid is strongly evinced ; and , as we have already observed , the coals formed artificially from vegetable substances , by means of sulphuric acid , bear a strong resemblance to the mineral coals , not only in their external characters , but also in their other properties .

rsc610455	emanations|emanation	matter			While the products like the emanations , and UrX , lose their activity according to an exponential law , the matter emanation X , which gives rise to the phenomena of excited activity , does not lose its activity according to a simple law .
rsc610455	emanation	thorium			The author has shown that the excited activity produced in a body by a short exposure in the presence of the thorium emanation increases at first for a few hours , passes through a maximum value , and then decays with the time according to an exponential law .

rsc610862	impregnation|impregnation				Thus the conclusions to be drawn from the facts of natural impregnation in the Toad , fully agree with those deduced from artificial impregnation in the Frog , and seem to establish the view , that while an increase of temperature is required for the fiulfilment of the reproductive function in that animal , and to maintain the efficiency of the spermatozoa , the fecundatory force of the agent is of shorter duration , and corresponds to its more early cessation of motion .
rsc610862	impregnated	the egg of the frog			I had again and again found , as before shown , that the egg of the frog may be impregnated , under certain conditions , by the direct application of spermatozoa to almost any part of its surface , and this enabled me to put the question of penetration to the test .

rsc65024	odour		alliaceous		But this is very far from conveying a just idea of the degree to which this mode of detection may be carried : for a single drop of the aqueous arsenious acid would have afforded ample evidence of the arsenic as it respected colour , insolubility in muriatic and sulphuric acids , alliaceous odour , and volatility ; which would give the a oth part of a grain .

What gives still further interest to these experiments is , that , having operated during the severe weather of last winter , when little or no life existed in the atmosphere , I was able to impregnate the fluids with germs without introducing developed life .

rsc613970	Smelling		acute		In most of other Animals , neither is this anterior Production of the Brain so great , the Perforations of the Os Cri ' orosum so many , nor its extent so large : But in Animals of an acute Smelling , besides the Perforations of the Os Cribrosum , there are several spongious Laminae which arise from its lower part ; each whereof are endued with Tunicles , wherein are variously dispersed several Branches of the Nervus Olfactorius ; and these Laminae are set very near to one another , as it were the Teeth in a Comb , or the Lamellae in the lower Part of some Mushromes .
rsc613970	Smelling		the more acute		~ and it is observable , that such Creatures as have most of these Laminae have their Smelling the more acute .
rsc613970	Smelling		so acute		Therefore to supply this defect , and still to continue the Smelling so acute , if not more in this than in many other Animals , it is provided , that the anterior Fossa should be very deep , that the Production of the Brain in it might be the greater ; and lest its Surface should still be too small , there should be eminent Lines both in the Vomer and throughout the rest of the Bone , that there might still be more space for branching out the Nerve , as it proceeds from its Origin .
rsc613970	Smelling|Smelling	Substance			because the Brain is more pendent here than elsewhere , they may serve as so many Columns to support it , lest by its Weight it should lean too much upon the Os Cribrosum , so that the Origin of the Nervus Olfactorius being too much pressed , instead of a clear , might afford a very confused Idea of Smelling ; and , that even within the Scull it may be so divided and dispersed in this Animal , as it uses to be without it in others : So that the defect of the Laminae Spongios ~ without , is ~ by this diversity of Perforations and Eminences in the Os Cribrosum within Indeed in Horses there is somewhat of this Structure to be ~ The Os Cribrosum seems to be proportionally as large ; its Perforations as frequent ; and the Laminae Spongiosae without , both - few and thin set ; by which that Creature has but an ordinary Sensation of Smelling , and only such as is convenient for the choice of its Food ; because the Nervus Olfactorius has not such a space wherein to be dispersed , as the Septum and Cartilaginous Sides of the Proboscis ; which is so great , that scarce can a Particle of any odoriferous Substance escape the touching of some one or other of the Nervous Filaments : Whereas in Horses , there being but a short space betwixt the Os Cribrosum and the Nose , the additional Surfaces of the Laminae Spongiosae , and the tension of the Bone of the Nose on both sides , otherwise than in the Elephant , who has no Bone there at all , are very convenient to supply that defect ; for you know the more extended a Nerve is , the greater is its Sensation , and a Bone is fitter for tension than either a Cartilage or other soft Substances are .

rsc612340	smell		pungent		o02 , and a smell as pungent , and a little resembling that of strong acetic acid ; at the boiling temperature it had a slight solvent action on sulphur , when the latter had been presented to it in a very divided state , but most of the sulphur thus dissolved separated again on cooling , the rest which it still retained ater cooling , and which is foreign to its composition , may be detected by nitrate of silver , or by nitrate of protoxide of mercury , which form with the red tinging acid in the pure state , precipitates which are white and continue so , but with the acid holding sulphur in s48 solution , these precipitates have rather a dark colour .
rsc612340	smell				It has the following characters ; It is of a pale lemon yellow colour ; it has no smell ; it is decomposed by a gentle heat , or by exposure to a strong light ; prussic acid is then formed , and white triple prussiate of iron , which quickly absorbing oxygen from the air , changes to blue triple prussiate .
rsc612347	smell		very offensive		The inflammable air produced in this manner is of the lightest kind , and free from that very offensive smell which is generally occasioned by the rapid solution of metals in oil of vitriol , and it is extricated in as little time in this way as it is possible to do it by any mode of solution .

rsc615921	emanation		very quickly decaying		These tests were not started quickly enough to give information as to the presence of a very quickly decaying emanation .
rsc615921	emanation		distinct from		It is still possible that it does so , but , if so , this substance gives no emanation distinct from that of radium .
rsc615921	emanation	thorium|monazite			The minerals were all tested for thorium emanation by drawing aii over them in the cold ; the only one in the above list that gives it is the Norwegian monazite , and even this does not yield it very abundantly .
rsc615921	emanation	thorium			A crystal of thorite , however , kindly lent me by Professor Lewis , was found to give torrents of thorium emanation .
rsc615921	emanation		radium		It was not permissible to heat the specimen , which might have injured it 1 so that the presence or absence of radium emanation in thorite could not be investigated .
rsc615921	emanation	radium	amount|so small		They were , moreover markedly radio - active , while the amount of radium emanation obtained from them was so small that their activity could not be mainly due to radium .
rsc615921	emanation	radium	amount|so small		They were , moreover markedly radio - active , while the amount of radium emanation obtained from them was so small that their activity could not be mainly due to radium .
rsc615921	emanation	thorium			That is , the thorium emanation , though formed , is not able to escape .
rsc615921	emanation		radium		It is interesting to know whether the minerals retain all the radium emanation which they generate when heat is not used to expel it .
rsc615921	emanation				A similar experiment with malacone showed that about one - fiftieth of its emanation was able to escape in the cold .
rsc615921	emanation	these minerals			It appears , therefore , that these minerals retain nearly all their emanation .
rsc615921	emanation				Samarskite which had been heated to redness was found to retain its emanation in the cold about as well as before .
rsc615921	emanation	of radium			It proved to be identical with the rate of decay of the emanation of radium * The activity is wholly due to that element .
rsc615921	emanation		distinct		On heating , a distinct emanation was obtained , giving several times the rate of leak that air did .
rsc615921	emanations	from these deposits			The following table gives the quantitative data for these emanations from these deposits .
rsc615921	emanation|emanation				Although the agreement in the rate of decay of the emanation * In the first experiment made , I obtained a small residual leak when the radium emanation had decayed .
rsc615921	emanation		new|of greater durability		This was attributed to a new emanation , of greater durability .
rsc615921	emanation	from 100 grammes			Rate of leak due to emanation from 100 grammes .
rsc615921	emanation		characteristic		The method is of course useless for testing the presence or absence of radio - active elements such as uranium , J which do not give off a characteristic emanation .
rsc615921	emanation	from the dissolved			But no emanation could be obtained , either from the dissolved salts or from the deposit .
rsc615921	emanation|emanation	from re - crystallised uranium nitrate	distinct|feeble		J I have found a distinct , though feeble , emanation from re - crystallised uranium nitrate , having a rate of decay equal to that of the radium emanation .
rsc615921	emanation|emanation	from re - crystallised uranium nitrate	distinct|feeble		J I have found a distinct , though feeble , emanation from re - crystallised uranium nitrate , having a rate of decay equal to that of the radium emanation .
rsc615921	emanation		new		No new emanation has been recognised .
rsc615921	emanation		decidedly more permanent than		If any emanation decidedly more permanent than that of radium i existed in the evolved gas , the method could not fail to detect it .
rsc615921	emanation|emanation		more durable|radium		Tf a more durable emanation had been present even in small quantities , the proportion of it present would have increased relatively to the radium emanation , and its presence would have become apparent towards the end , by a diminished rate of decay .
rsc615921	emanation		less durable		Small quantities of an emanation less durable than that of radium might have escaped detection .
rsc615921	emanation		accumulated		By measuring the rate of leak due to the accumulated emanation i from a weighed amount , the proportion of radium present may be s estimated .
rsc615921	emanation				A comparison with the leak due to the emanation of a known weight of radium must of course be made .
rsc615921	emanation		so strong		In some cases the emanation was initially so strong that it could not be conveniently investigated .

rsc66101	Effluvium		Force		All which Phenomena , altho they do not happen at every Trial exactly as ~ have here delivered them , yet I have sometimes seen them , and in a great measure at all times , are very agreeable to this account , notwithstanding the Force and Vigour of the Effluvium is sometimes less than what at other times I have found it .
rsc66101	Effluvia		such quantity		But to proceed : When the Glass became hottest by the greatest ~ , it did then send forth such quantity of Effluvia , not only performing the Effects beforementioned with seemingly greater Vigour , but being nearly applied to the Face , or any tender part , might be sensibly felt , as if the Part was pushed with the points of a considerable number of weak Hairs .
rsc66101	Effluivum|Effluvia|Effluvia		Humid		In this place I think it will not be amiss to take notice , That , considering the Vigorous Action of the Effluivum , I thought it would not be unnecessary to attempt a discovery of the figure of its Motion , by Approaching the Affricated Tube to the flame of a ~ ~ Smoke , Steem , Dust , and to the Surfaces of Liquids ; which I did without any manner of success : And which I wholly attribute to the reason before given , of the Humid Effluvia suddenly Condensing on the Warm Glass ; so the Oleagenous Quality of the Flame and Smoke , the Moistness of the Steam , the Smallness of the Dast , or the Effluvia of the Liquids , would immediately adhere to all parts of the Affricated Tube , as it was approached within their Spheres , preventing the Operation of its ~ , which then seemed to be stopped , or retired within itself ; and required a new Attrition to give it vent .
rsc66101	Effluvium				SInce this Account was wrote , I procured a solid Tube , about the bigness and of the same Metal with the other ; but upon trial of it find no great Difference in its Operations , in comparison with the other , only its Effluvium seemed to continue a little longer , but attracts not at a greater distance than the other that I can discover .
rsc66101	Effluvium	of Glass			I then took a piece of fine Muslin , which was sowed to two Wires bent Archwise , that it might surround the upper surface of the Glass , almost at four Inches distance from it ~ The Muslin I made as ragged ( by breaking the Threads of it every where ) as I could , ( for I find that Small and Light Bodies are most apt to be affected by the Effluvium of Glass ) then the Motion and Attrition being given , it was pleasing enough to see a Multitude of small Sparks of Light every where on the ends of the torn Threads , which resembled so many little Stars observable in a good Tellescope in the Via Lactea ; and the whole was attended with such a whiteness , by the little Light proceeding from them , as in that part of the Hemisphere taken notice of , by those who behold it with the naked Eye .
rsc66101	Effluvium	pieces of Leaf Brass			I Took a Hollow Tube of fine Flint Glass , about an Inch Diameter and 30 in Length , which having rubbed pretty smartly with Paper in my Hand , till it had acquired some degree of Heat ; it was then held towards some pieces of Leaf Brass , which so soon as its Effluvium had reached , became suddenly in Motion , flying towards the Tube , even at 9 or 10 Inches distance ; and it seemed that the hotter the Tube was made by Rubbing , the farther it would Attract , but that it would do so to any Degree of Heat , I dare not determine .
rsc66102	Felis|Felis				He says : """" Hyrax agrees , therefore , with Felis not only in the form and structure of the placenta , but in the large size of the sac of the allantois ; it differs in the condition of the umbilical vesicle , which disappears in Hyrax apparently at an early period , but remains in Felis to the end of utero - gestation .

rsc612376	smelt	of sulphur			The 20th in the afternoon , being on the former spot , I saw a small fog coming from the sea ( from the same quarter whence the smoke appeared ) , which smelt of sulphur ; and the wind returning to the east , the fog retired to the sea ; and in the morning of the 21st , about nine o ' clock , we felt two shocks of an earthquake sufficiently violent , but no more smoke was seen .
rsc612376	smell		disagreeable		I forgot to observe to you , that , during the time of the earthquake , and indeed preceding it , was heard a hollow dreadful noise , but I did not observe any disagreeable smell , or alteration in the air , the sky being as serene as usual , and the after - part of the day without a breath of air .

rsc61637	Effluvia	the Sulphur			Now , though these Particles repel each other , they attract the Air very strongly , as appears by the following Experiment : Take a tall Glass Receiver closed at Top , holding about four Quarts of Air , and having put its open End over a Bundle of Brimstone Matches on Fire , standing up in the Middle of a large Dish with Water in it , ( to keep the Air from coming in at the Bottom of the said Receiver ) you will observe , that not only as soon as the Matches are burnt out , but a good while before , the Air , instead of being expanded by the Flame of the Brimstone , will retire into less Compass , the Water beginning to rise from the Dish up into the Receiver , and continuing so to do till some time after the Matches are burnt out ; so that there will be in the Receiver only three Quarts of Air , instead of four ( more or less , in proZ 2 portion portion to the Quantity of Brimstone burnt ) : And this plainly happens by some of the Effluvia , or little Parts of the Sulphur , attracting some of the Particles of the Air , so as to make an unelastic Compound , that precipitates into the Water .

rsc613914	emanation	gas from thorium			The name ' emanation ' was originally given to the radioactive gas from thorium , and has since been applied to the similar gaseous products of radium and actinium .
rsc613914	emanation	radium			Finding the name ' radium emanation ' somewhat long and clumsy , Sir WILLIAM has recently suggested ' ex - radio ' as an equivalent .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation		radium		Since the value of for is about the same as for the radium emanation , the maximum weight present per gramme is about of the weight of the emanation , i .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation				Since the , radium , and radium , expel particles , the volume of helium produced during the life of the emanation should be three times the initial volume of the emanation .

rsc613914	emanation	nan Radium			Radium first of all produces an emanation , which , like thorium , is transformed into a non - volatile substance .
rsc613914	emanation	thorium			As a typical example of the evidence , from which it is deduced that one substance is the parent of another , we will consider the connection of the two products and the thorium emanation .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation		very little		This cannot be ascribed to a prevention of escape of the emanation produced in it , for very little emanation is observed when a current of air is drawn through the hydroxide in a state of solution , .

rsc613914	emanation|emanation				The curve of decay of activity on a body after removal of the emanation , and the rise of activity after the introduction of the emanation , are in all cases complementary to one another .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation|emanation				The rate of production of emanation thus falls off to the same law and at the same rate as the activity of the measured in the ordinary manner by the rays , Now this is exactly the result to be expected if the is the parent of the emanation , for the activity of at any time is proportional to its rate of change , , to the rate of production of the secondary type of matter by the emanation in consequence of a change in it .
rsc613914	emanation		radium		For example , it is found that if a body is introduced for a short interval , about 1 minute , into a vessel containing the radium emanation , which has remained undisturbed for several hours , the activity after the first rapid decay curve is in much greater proportion than if an electric field had been acting for some time previously .
rsc613914	emanation		radium		CURIE have observed that bodies which have been exposed for a long interval in the presence of the radium emanation do not lose all of their activity .
rsc613914	emanating|emanation	the hydroxide			The observed fact that the hydroxide regains its power of emanating in the course of time due to the production of fresh by the thorium , which in turn produces the emanation .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation				In a similar way , excited activity is produced on bodies over which the emanation is passed , and in amount proportional to the activity of the emanation , i .
rsc613914	emanation		radium		The results , so far as they have gone , show that the residual activity produced on bodies exposure to the radium emanation is very complicated .
rsc613914	emanation		large amount of radium		The active matter deposited on the glass tube , in which a large amount of radium emanation had bsen stored for a month , was dissolved in sulphuric acid .
rsc613914	emanation|emanation				The evidence thus seems to be conclusive that is the parent of the emanation and that the emanation is the parent of the deposited matter .

rsc613914	emanations				In a case like uranium , which is probably half transformed in about 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 years , the atoms must be considered as very stable compared with products like the emanations of thorium or radium .

rsc613914	emanation	radium			Since the discovery of the actual production of helium from the radium emanation by RAMSAY and SODDY , there has been a tendency to assume that helium is the final transformation product of radium .
rsc613914	emanation	radium			This conclusion is supported by measurements of the mass of the particle , and by the observations of the rate of production of helium by the radium emanation made by RAMSAY and SODDY .

rsc614343	emanation|emanation		condensed|considerable		Now this in itself would afford no evidence of the effect sought , for it is well known that when a large quantity of radium emanation is condensed in liquid air , the condensation is by no means complete , and there always exists in the vessel , above the condensed emanation , a considerable quantity of emanation in the gaseous state .
rsc614343	emanation	nan			emanation could be completely obliterated .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				The emanation was then condensed in the narrow tube and the plate again exposed to the radiation from the emanation .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				The quantity of emanation is expressed in terms of the amount of emanation which would lie in equilibrium with a definite number of milligrammes of radium bromide .

rsc614343	emanation|emanation|emanation	from 30|milligrammes of radium bromide	uncondensed|liquefied		The early experiments were carried out with the emanation from 30 or 40 milligrammes of radium bromide in order to get as large an effect as possible ; but although the radiation increased with the quantity of emanation used , it was soon found to be more advantageous to work with considerably smaller quantities , on account of the large quantity of uncondensed emanation existing above the liquefied emanation when working with these large quantities .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation|emanation	from 30|milligrammes of radium bromide	uncondensed|liquefied		The early experiments were carried out with the emanation from 30 or 40 milligrammes of radium bromide in order to get as large an effect as possible ; but although the radiation increased with the quantity of emanation used , it was soon found to be more advantageous to work with considerably smaller quantities , on account of the large quantity of uncondensed emanation existing above the liquefied emanation when working with these large quantities .
rsc614343	emanation		quantity		Although no complete investigation of this rather remarkable phenomenon was at the time possible , a few experiments were made to see what quantity of emanation would give as small a """" vapour pressure """" as possible , consistent with the condition of giving a measurable radiation of active deposit particles .
rsc614343	emanation	of radium			As there appear to be no available data on the variation of the apparent vapour pressure of radium emanation with the quantity used , it seems 210 Messrs .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation		uncondensed		Reference to column III of Table I shows the variation of the vapour pressure with the quantity of emanation used , for the activity which reaches the back of the plate is due entirely to the uncondensed emanation present in the apparatus .
rsc614343	emanation		uncondensed		The activity of the back of the plate after removal therefore gives an estimate in arbitrary units of the quantity of uncondensed emanation .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				A few experiments were next made to determine in absolute measure the quantity of emanation remaining uncondensed above different quantities of liquefied emanation .
rsc614343	emanation	from a known quantity of radium			For this purpose the emanation from a known quantity of radium was condensed in a U - tube immersed in liquid air .
rsc614343	emanation	RaBr2			Milligrammes of RaBr2 in equilibrium with emanation condensed .
rsc614343	emanation	RaBr2			Milligrammes of RaBr2 in equilibrium with emanation vapour per c .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation		uncondensed		No doubt the apparent vapour pressure of the emanation may depend on a variety of conditions not here investigated , but although the experiments quoted are few and the conditions unvaried , they suffice to indicate that the quantity of uncondensed emanation above the liquid may be considerable when working with large quantities of emanation .
rsc614343	emanation		small quantities		211 decided to work with as small quantities of emanation as possible in subsequent experiments .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				It was found difficult to condense the emanation at the bottom of the tube , for when the tube was immersed in liquid air the emanation tended to condense in a fluorescent ring round the tube on a level with the surface of the liquid air .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation		condensed		The disc D was suspended at different distances above the emanation and measurement made of the activity acquired by it in half an hour , when at different distances from the condensed emanation .
rsc614343	emanation		condensed		Distance of disc in centimetres from condensed emanation .
rsc614343	emanation	radium			Since the range in air of the a - particle from radium emanation is 4 * 35 cm .
rsc614343	emanation				The case is similar for the production of radium B from radium A , for the range of the a - particle from radium A is nearly the same as that from the emanation , being 4 * 62 cm .
rsc614343	emanation	radium			Thus , when we have radium emanation , condensed at the bottom of a tube , we have projected from it particles of radium A and radium B of about the same penetrating power .
rsc614343	emanation		constant quantity		1 ) was exposed to the radiation of a constant quantity of emanation and the pressure of the gas between the source of radiation and the disc varied .
rsc614343	emanation	radium B	radium		There is some evidence that radium B can escape from a surface which has been exposed to the radium emanation and which is therefore coated with a film of active deposit .
rsc614343	emanation	radium B	radium		There is some evidence that radium B can escape from a surface which has been exposed to the radium emanation and which is therefore coated with a film of active deposit .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				Having regard to the difficulty of knowing exactly where the emanation is condensed and , therefore , of determining the distances of the discs from the emanation , these numbers are in fair agreement .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				above the emanation , and the pressure of the air between the emanation and the disc was maintained below 001 millimetre of 1909 .
rsc614343	emanation	radium			The difference between the two curves is striking and can at once be explained if we suppose that , whereas when a negatively - charged conductor is exposed to the emanation only radium A is deposited , which subsequently disintegrates , in the present case both radium A and radium B reach the plate by radiation .
rsc614343	emanation	radium B			Having established that both radium A and radium B are projected on to a disc through a vacuum from the emanation condensed at the bottom 218 Messrs .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				This can be done by considering the activity of a disc exposed to the radiation from the emanation for a time sufficient for radioactive equilibrium to be set up between the emanation and the particles of radium A and radium B on the disc .
rsc614343	emanation	from IT8|of radium			A disc was therefore exposed for more than three hours to the emanation from IT8 milligrammes of radium which had been condensed at the bottom of the tube for sufficient time for equilibrium to be set up between the .
rsc614343	emanation	nan			emanation and its products of disintegration .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				Since 1T8 milligrammes of emanation were used in the experiment , the quantity of radium A and radium C on the disc was 2 ' 92 x 10 - 4 of the total quantity of ladium A and radium C in equilibrium with the emanation .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				from the emanation , and that the area of the disc was 2 * 01 square centimetres , it is clear that even if every particle of radium A and radium B escaped from the emanation as it was formed by the expulsion of an a - particle , the fraction of the whole radiation reaching the disc would have been 3 - 3 x 10 - 3 .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation|emanation				219 these particles by matter , there seems little doubt that with a sufficiently thin layer of emanation free from all impurities and in a sufficiently high vacuum every particle of radium A and radium B emitted from the emanation would be radiated from the emanation .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation	active			The experiments with radium emanation condensed at the bottom of a tube have shown that active deposit particles are projected through a vacuum on to a disc exposed above the emanation .
rsc614343	emanation	radium B			Since in these circumstances we have , besides the emanation , also radium A and radium B at the bottom of the tube , the conditions are somewhat complicated .
rsc614343	emanation		considerable quantity|radium		The plate D , which had been exposed to a considerable quantity of radium emanation for a definite time , was suspended by a small hook from the end of the wire w , the other end of which was sealed through the ground glass stopper S of the glass Fig .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation	radium			Consider the case in which the plate P has been exposed to the emanation so that it has deposited on its surface radium A , together with radium B and radium C in certain definite proportions depending on the time of exposure to the emanation .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation				In the first series of observations the plate P was exposed to the emanation for 10 minutes , then removed and placed in a vessel which could be quickly evacuated to remove any emanation adhering to the disc .
rsc614343	emanation	radium|radium B			The experiments to be described in this paper afford direct evidence of the recoil of radium A , radium B , and radium C , when formed respectively from the emanation , radium A , and radium B .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation|emanation				therefore again exposed to the emanation for about two hours and a half , and was then removed from the emanation and kept in a vacuum for 19 minutes , to get rid of emanation adhering to it .
rsc614343	emanation|emanation	radium			S It is well known that when radium emanation is exposed to an electric field the active deposit appears almost entirely on the cathode , indicating that , by some process which is not yet fully understood , the atom of radium A , when formed from the emanation , acquires a positive charge .
rsc614343	emanation	radium			The principal results obtained in this paper may be summarised as follows : \ # 151 ; ( 1 ) When radium emanation , in radio - active equilibrium with its products of disintegration , is condensed at the bottom of an evacuated tube immersed in liquid air , active deposit particles are radiated up the tube .
rsc614343	emanation		condensed		The radiation reaching a surface at a fixed distance from the condensed emanation is an exponential function of the gas pressure .
rsc614343	emanation	by the expulsion of an a - particle			We have seen that when radium A is produced from the emanation by the expulsion of an a - particle , there is reason to expect that the atom of radium A is projected with sufficient velocity to cause it to travel a considerable distance through an evacuated space .

rsc611785	Effluvia|Effluvia		Electric|Electric		Does it not appear to be , that at first the external Air by its Resistance drives back the Electric Effluvia , which go then to the Inside of the Globe , where there is the least Resistance ? For we observe , that as the Air comes in , it repels the Electric Effluvia , that go inwards no longer , when all the Air is come in .
rsc611785	Effluvia	of Sulphur			Will not this Phenomenon be explained by the different Electricity of Sulphur and Air ? The Effluvia of Sulphur , being electric , repel one another ; and the Particles of Air , being also electric , do likewise repel each other .

rsc64009	smell		exceeding putrid		I had left the mouth of the receiver open ; and on my return the 1 st of August , I found an exceeding putrid smell ; I covered the vessel ; and the 2d , examined the fluid , but it did not effervesce any more .
rsc64009	smell		so disagreeable		On opening the vessels , the smell was again entirely changed , not near so disagreeable as before .
rsc64009	smell	of a volatile alcali			In the receiver I obtained a fluid , which turned the syrup of violets green , effervesced very smartly with the very same spirit of vitriol I had used before ; gave the smell of a volatile alcali , on adding to this the fixed alcali ; praecipitated the calces of metals dissolved in acids , and showed itself by all proofs a true volatile alcali .
rsc64009	smell		herbaceous		I put to it some water ; and after 24 hours , it gave the herbaceous smell , but showed no signs of any alcali .
rsc64009	smell		herbaceous		I let it stand four days longer : the herbaceous smell continued ; but there was no alcali to be discovered .
rsc64009	smell	matter	putrid		I had poured , the 3d of August , some fresh water on the putrid matter ; its putrid smell continued ; the 7th I decanted the fluid , filtrated it , and made it undergo the same operation , with exactly the same effect as before ; which I did again the 11th , with the very same effect .

rsc64009	smell		herbaceous		continues ; and that this volatile alcali is the basis of it , because , as this was distilled over , the residuum , being still in intestine motion , got only the herbaceous smell .
rsc64009	smell				For this reason , I suppose , the putrefying matter shows in its beginning no sign of a volatile alcali ; because its smell depends only on those particles , which have been on the surface , without any strong cohesion with the substance .

rsc66163	emanation		active		It will be shown later that the yearly course of the radio - active emanation in the air is exactly ' opposite to that of the ionization .
rsc66163	emanation		less radio - active		ELSTER and GEITEL * made the very important discovery that the atmosphere always contains more or less radio - active emanation .
rsc66163	emanation|emanation		radio|active		During the whole of 1902 LSTER and GEITEL made daily observations of the radio - activity , and found that the amount of emanation in the atmosphere depends largely on some teorological conditions , such as the rising or falling of the barometer and temperature ; and , as a result of their work , made the suggestion that the emanation in the air is supplied entirely by the radium or radio - active emanation contained in the soil .
rsc66163	emanation|emanation				But that does not prove that the ionization is not due to the emanation ; we can my say that if it is , then the increase in the production of ions owing to the excess of emanation is overbalanced - by the increased rate of recombination due to the winter conditions .
rsc66163	emanation		active		That all the relations shown by the above analysis should be as they are gives an exceedingly strong support to ELSTER and GEITEL ' S theory of the origin of the atmospheric radio - active emanation .
rsc66163	emanation		radium		According to their theory , the air which is mixed up with the soil of the ground becomes highly charged with radium emanation .
rsc66163	emanation		escaped		A high wind is naturally accompanied by low activity , for it acts as a stirrer , and rapidly mixes the escaped emanation with a large volume of air .
rsc66163	emanation				If air stream out of the ground when the barometer falk , it must charge the atmosphere with its emanation .
rsc66163	emanation|emanation		highly		This cold air flowing over the ground will sweep the emanation along with it , and so the valley will become filled with air highly charged with emanation .

rsc61651	Effluvia|Smell		offensive		That there are Effluvia emitted from the Tube when rubbed , and which surround it as an Atmosphere , is evident , from that offensive Smell arising from them , from that Sensation on the Hands or Face , when the Tube is brought near either of them , and from those Sparks of Light , on a still nearer Approach of the Finger to it .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				From this Property it is , that these Effluvia expand themselves with so great a Velocity whenever they are separated from the electric Body ; and as they are likewise capable of being greatly condensed , may we not from hence justly conclude they are elastic ? That there is a mutual Attraction between these Effluvia and most other Bodies , appears from their collecting from the Tube such Quantities thereof , as to endue them with the same Properties with the Tube itself , as was proved by the 3d , 4th , and 5th but more particularly by the 6th Experiment .
rsc61651	Effuvia		electrical		These Principles being admitted , it will follow , that the greater Difference there is in the Quantity of electrical Effuvia in any two Bodies , the stronger will be their Attraction .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia		electrical		Upon which I observe , that whenever the Sphere is excited , the electrical Effluvia are thereby put into Motion , and made to form an Atmosphere round about it , from whence , by their repulsive Property , they endeavour to expand themselves on all Sides equally ; but being strongly attracted by the Iron , a great Part of them are drawn off along the Rod , about whose Surface they likewise form an Atmosphere , which will be denser or rarer , in proportion as the Attraction of the Rod is greater or less ; and as the repulsive Power of these Effluvia will always increase in proportion with their Density , it will follow , that whenever the Sphere is so strongly excited , that the Effluvia surrounding it are denser than those surrounding the Rod , they will , by their repulsive Property , drive the Effluvia off from the End of it in a Stream , and that with a very great Velocity ; as is evident , from their strikeing against the Hand like a Blast of Wind when brought near the End of the Rod : And as this Velocity is partly owing to the Attraction of the Rod , so this Attraction continuing quite to the End of it , the Velocity of the Particles will there be greatest ; and as they approach towards the Point , they will be brought nearer together , and therefore become denser there than in any other Part of the Rod ; and therefore if the Light is owing to the Density and Velocity of the Effluvia , it will be visible at the Point , and no - where else .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				For , let the Motion of the Wheel which turns the Sphere be stopped , the Current of the Effluvia will likewise be stopped , and the Rays of Light will no longer be seen to issue from the Point , and yet the whole Rod will continue to be electrical ; but , on putting the Sphere again into Motion , the Effluvia will become visible as before , and will increase , as the Sphere is more strongly excited .
rsc61651	Effluvia		electrical		SIR , IN the * Letter lately read before the Royal Society from the Abbe Nolet , containing his Observations on the Increase of the Transpiration of Animals , and the Growth of Vegetables , by means of the electrical Effluvia , he takes notice , that he was led to those Inquiries , from the Acceleration which ( he found from a great Number of Experiments ) was given to the Motion of Fluids thro ' capillary Tubes , upon their being electrified .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				Several very ingenious Gentlemen , and in particular the Abbe Nollet have imagined , that the Light seen at the Point of the Non - electric was produced by means of Effluvia issuing from it in diverging Rays towards the electrified Rod , and which Current of Effluvia is therefore supposed to be the Cause of the attractive , as a like Current issuing at the same time from the electrified Rod is supposed to be the Cause of the repulsive Property of Electricity .
rsc61651	Effluvia		electrical		I observed , in my former Paper , that several ingenious Gentlemen , from this Appearance of a Light at the Point of the Non - electric , have imagined there was a Current of electrical Effluvia continually issuing out of it , and which , setting in towards the electrified Rod , was the Cause of the Attraction of the Electricity : And this Conjecture of theirs will seem to be greatly favoured by the following Experiment .
rsc61651	Effluvia		excited|much stronger		Secondly , That the Effluvia are not to be equally excited in all Bodies , but much stronger in some than in others ; and that , in particular , they are not capable of being at all excited in Metals by Friction .
rsc61651	Effluvia		the least Quantity|electrical		Fourthly , That those Bodies which are most easily excited by Friction , will receive the least Quantity of the electrical Effluvia from any other excited Body ; and , on the contrary , Metals , or those Bodies in which they cannot be excited by Friction , will receive the most .
rsc61651	Effluvia		electrical		And as those Bodies , at whose Point this Light appears the strongest , afford us no Signs of their having any of the electrical Effluvia residing in them , either by their attracting or repelling other Bodies , or by their being capable of being excited in them by Friction , as in Glass , ~ c .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia|impregnated|Effluvia				nor in short any sort of Evidence whatsoever , but what arises from this Appearance ; may we not expect some better Proof of their being possessed of these Effluvia , before we admit of their issuing out of them ? Again , it appears very extraordinary , that those Bodies , in which the Effluvia cannot be excited by any other Method , should send forth such Streams of them , only on their being brought within a few Inches of the electrified Rod , and that these Streams should increase as the Rod is more strongly electrified ; and yet that few or none of these Streams should issue from those Bodies in which the Effluvia can be excited : And if the first - mention ' d Bodies are themselves strongly impregnated , the Streams will disappear , and they will be so far from parting with any of their Effluvia , that , on the contrary , they will be strongly repelled by the Rod .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				I farther apprehend , on this Supposition , it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to account for the ceasing of the Stream from the Point of the Non - electric on stopping the Machine ; as likewise that the Rod should so soon be divested of its Effluvia , on such a Non - electric ' s being held near it , which it would otherwise retain for several Hours , and which I think is a strong Proof of the Effluvia ' s passing from the Rod into the Non electric .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				And that it certainly does so , may be confirmed by the Person who holds the Non - electric stepping upon a Cake of Wax , when he will soon become electrical , from the Effluvia he will receive ( thro ' the Point of the Nonelectric ) from the Rod ; but so long as he continues to se so , there will not be seen any Light to issue from the Point ; which I apprehend cannot be accounted for on any other Principle , but that of the setting in of the Effluvia at the Point of the Non - electric .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia		different Density|much denser		The true Cause of this remarkable Phenomenon I apprehend to be the different Density of the Effluvia at the Extremities of the two Bodies ; for I have already shown the Effluvia will be much denser at the Extremity of a pointed Body than at an obtuse one : And as the Force by which the Particles endeavour to expand themselves , increases in proportion to their Density , it follows , that the Particles will be reflected back with greater Violence from the pointed Body than the other ; and this Force exceeding the attractive Power of that particular Part of the Feather , to which it is directed , the Fibres will be repelled by it ; whereas the Force , with which the Particles endeavour to expand themselves from the obtuse Body , being less than the attractive Power , it follows , that the Fibres of the Feather will continue to be attracted by it .
rsc61651	Effluvia		different Quantity of electric		I have already shown , that the Attraction between any two Bodies will always be in proportion to the different Quantity of electric Effluvia they are possessed of ; the greater that Difference is , the greater will be the Attraction .
rsc61651	Effluvia|impregnated		electric		It is well known , that , by the Attraction between any two Bodies , the electric Effluvia are continually drawn off from that which has the greatest Quantity of them , till the other being sufficiently impregnated , the Attraction ceases .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia	Leaf -	electrical		In order therefore to preserve these Proportions , it is necessary , that , as fast as the non - electric Plate draws off any of the Effluvia from the Leaf - Silver , it should part with it again ; and so , by continuing to be a Nonelectric , an equal Degree of Attraction be preserved ; and again , that the Leaf - Silver should receive a fresh Supply from the electrical Plate , equal to what it constantly parts with ; and the electrical Plate must likewise receive an equal Supply from the Globe ; and that there is such a constant Current of the electrical Effluvia , is evident , from those small Streams of Light , visible at the two Corners of the Silver next the Plates .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia	Leaf -	electrical		In order therefore to preserve these Proportions , it is necessary , that , as fast as the non - electric Plate draws off any of the Effluvia from the Leaf - Silver , it should part with it again ; and so , by continuing to be a Nonelectric , an equal Degree of Attraction be preserved ; and again , that the Leaf - Silver should receive a fresh Supply from the electrical Plate , equal to what it constantly parts with ; and the electrical Plate must likewise receive an equal Supply from the Globe ; and that there is such a constant Current of the electrical Effluvia , is evident , from those small Streams of Light , visible at the two Corners of the Silver next the Plates .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				That the Leaf - Silver is always nearer to the nonelectrical than to the electrified Plate , is owing to its receiving its Supply of Effluvia from the Atmosphere surrounding the electrified Plate : For as the Plate is more strongly electrified than the Silver , its Atmosphere of Effluvia will be denser to a greater Distance than that surrounding the Leaf - Silver , and therefore can supply an equal Quantity at a greater Distance than what the lower Plate can receive from the Silver , whose Atmosphere is rarer ; and therefore , as the Silver will always be suspended in that Part where the two Currents are equal , without which I have already shown the Proportion would be destroyed , it will consequently be always nearer to the non - electrical than to the electrified Plate .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Smeil		offensive		But to leave no Room for any Objection , I would beg Leave to observe , that the Existence of these Effluvia is proved by all those Experiments in which a Stream of Light is seen to issue from the electrified Body ; particularly those Streams which are seen to issue in diverging Rays from the End of the original Conductor , when made of Metal , and reduced to a Point ; from their being felt to strike against the Hand like a Blast of Wind , when it is brought near the Stream , and from that offensive Smeil which generally accompanies these Experiments , and which is always more perceptible , the more strongly the Sphere is excited .
rsc61651	Effluvia|impregnated|Effluvia				That the Particles composing these Effluvia repel each other , appears from those Experiments , in which two Bodies , how different soever they may be in kind , repel each other when they are sufficiently impregnated with these Effluvia .
rsc61651	Effluvia		considerable		As a Feather , by the excited Tube ; the several Fibres of the same Feather , or two Cork Balls , which will be found strongly to repel each other , so long as they retain any considerable Quantity of these Effluvia .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia		strong		That these Effluvia are strongly attracted by most if not all other Bodies , is so evident from almost all the electrical Experiments , as to make any particular Examples of it needless here ; especially as I shall have Occasion to take notice of the strong Attraction between the electrical Effluvia and Water , in accounting for these Experiments .
rsc61651	impregnated|Effluvia		electrical		If therefore Water is made to run in a Stream barely by its being impregnated with the electrical Effluvia , it should follow , that if one or more capillary Tubes be placed in a Vessel of Water , that which is sustained in them would either sink down to a Level with the rest of the Water , on its being made electrical , or at least that it would not continue at the same Height as before ; but if the Experiment is made , the Water will be found to continue exactly at the same Height , whether it is electrified or not .
rsc61651	impregnated|Effluvia		electrical		Again , if the bare electrifying the Water was the Cause of its running in a Stream , it would continue to run in the same manner , so long as the Water continued electrical , which it will not do : For , on stopping the Motion of the Machine , the Stream will immediately cease , and the Water will only drop from the Syphon , notwithstanding its being strongly impregnated with the electrical Effluvia .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia		electric		To account then for the Water ' s being made to run in a Stream in this Experiment , I would observe , that so long as the Machine is in Motion , there is a constant Succession of the electric Effluvia excited , and which visibly run off from the End of the prime Conductor in a Stream , and as they are in like manner carried off from all Bodies hung to it , those Effluvia which run off from the End of the Syphon , being strongly attracted by the Water , carry so much of it along with them , as to make it run in a constant Stream .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia		electric		That the Attraction between the Water and electric Effluvia is sufficient to produce this Effect , might be proved by a Variety of Experiments ; but I shall only observe , that to this Attraction it is owing that silk Lines and glass Tubes ( which , from their imbibing so very small a Quantity of these Effluvia , are generally made use of as Supports in many of the electrical Experiments ) on only being wetted become strong Conductors : And that if an excited Tube is held over a Vessel of Water , the Water is found to imbibe a very considerable Quantity of this electric Matter ; and , on the Approach of a Finger , or any other non - electric Body , the Water will be perceived to rise towards it ; and if the Finger is brought so near the Surface as to draw off the Effluvia , they will carry several Particles of the Water along with them towards the Finger , in a Direction directly contrary to that of Gravity ; and therefore may well be supposed , when acting in the same Direction , to have an Influence sufficient to produce a Stream , as in the Experiment .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				And that this Current of the electric Effluvia is the true Cause why the Water runs in a Stream from the End of the Syphon , is farther evident , in that whatever tends to increase or diminish the Current of the Effluvia , produces the same Effect upon the Water .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia				I have already observed , that when the Effluvia are strongly excited , they will be seen to pass off from the End of the prime Conductor in luminous Rays ; and the same may be observed with respect to those which pass with the Water from the End of the Syphon ; but if any non - electric Body is brought under the Syphon , as , by its Attraction , the Current of the Effluvia will be increased , so these luminous Rays will likewise extend to a greater Length .
rsc61651	Effluvia|impregnated|Effluvia		electrical		Again , if the Motion of the Machine is stopped , the Current of the electric Effluvia will thereby be stopped , and the Water will immediately cease to run in a Stream , notwithstanding its being strongly impregnated with the electrical Effluvia .
rsc61651	impregnated|Effluvia|Effluvia		repulsive|electric		And that the Water is strongly impregnated will not only appear from the Drops being sooner divided into small Particles than they would be if they had not been electrified , but from those Particles being separated to a greater Distance from each other , by the repulsive Property of the electric Effluvia ; and if any of the Water is received into a dry glass Vessel , on the Approach of a Finger towards its Surface , there will be seen a Spark to issue from it in the same manner as from Water electrified by an excited Tube ; or if any non - electrical Body is brought under the Syphon , by whose Attraction the Effluvia may be drawn off , the Water will immediately be found to accompany it in a Stream .
rsc61651	Effluvia|Effluvia|Effluvia		electrical		That the Water is made to run in a Stream , is plainly owing to the mutual Attraction between the electrised Body and the Water ; which Attraction will continue , so long as the Vessel which contains the Water , by being supported by a Non - electric , is prevented from retaining any of the electrical Effluvia ; these Effluvia being drawn off by the nonelectric Body , to which the Vessel is suspended : But on the contrary , when the Vessel is suspended by an Original Electric , the Effluvia , not being attracted thereby , will be prevented from running off , and the Water will soon be found to have imbibed a Quantity of them , sufficient , by their repelling Property , to greatly weaken , or wholly to destroy , the former Attraction , when the Water will cease to run in a Stream , and only drop , as if it had not been held near any electrised Body .
rsc61651	Smell		very strong offensive		The Tube is then said to be excited , or to be electrical ; and at some times , when it is strongly excited , Sparks will issue from the Tube in Streams , not only while it is rubbing , but will continue to dart out from it for a considerable time after the Rubbing has ceased , and a very strong offensive Smell will be perceived .
rsc61651	Smell		offensive		A Stream of Light will come from the End of it , if it is pointed ; it will attract , repel , and communicate this Virtue to any other non electric Body : On the Approach of a Non - electric , a Spark of Fire , with a Snap attending it , will come from it ; which Spark will be greater or less , as the Bodies approaching it have more or less of the electrical Quality residing in them ; and there will likewise be the same offensive Smell as was observed of the Tube .

rsc61712	effluvia	human|of marsh maismata			By the induction of numerous facts , two principal sources of continued fevers have been discovered , that is , the contagion of human effluvia , and of marsh maismata ~ the latter is distinguished by frequently assuming an intermittent type , or changing into a dysentery .
rsc61712	smell		noisome|offensive|peculiarly disgustful		These miserable wretches , even when they go abroad , carry a poisonous atmosphere round their bodies that is distinguished by a noisome and offensive smell , which is peculiarly disgustful even to the healthy and vigorous , exciting sickness and a sense of general debility .
rsc61712	effluvia		human		It had the common symptoms of malignant fevers produced by human effluvia , and particularly affected the head with pain , giddiness , and delirium .

rsc66173	impregnated	sea salt			The soil of the valleys and low grounds , which are occasionally swampy , is abundantly impregnated with sea salt , which the inhabitants wash out for their own consumption ; but it contains some bitter salts , which render it purgative to those who are not accustomed to it .

rsc6264	smell		gross		The burning of any substance occasions the same smell : for the gross fume which arises from them , before they flame , is the inflammable air they contain , which is expelled by heat , and then readily ignited .

rsc6264	smell				If a quantity of inflammable air be contained in a glass vessel standing in water , and have been generated very fast , it will smell even through the water , and this water will also soon become covered with a thin film , assuming all the different colours .

rsc6264	impregnate				Finding that water would imbibe inflammable air , I endeavoured to impregnate water with it , by the same process by which I had made water imbibe fixed air ; but though I found that distilled water would imbibe about one fourteenth of its bulk of inflammable air , I could not perceive that the taste of it was sensibly altered .
rsc6264	effluvium		noxious		The noxious effluvium with which air is loaded by animal respiration , is not absorbed by standing without agitation in fresh or salt water .
rsc6264	smell		offensive		I have even spent several hours in pouring this air from one glass vessel into another , in water , sometimes as cold , and sometimes as warm , as my hands could bear it , and have sometimes also wiped the vessels many times , during the course of the experiment , in order to take off that part of the noxious matter , which might adhere to the glass vessels , and which evidently gave them an offensive smell ; but all these methods were generally without any sensible effect .
rsc6264	effluvia		different		Among other experiments , I tried a great variety of different effluvia , which are continually exhaling into the air , especially of those substances which are known to resist putrefaction ; but I could not by these means effect any melioration of the noxious quality of this kind of air .
rsc6264	impregnate|effluvium	air|of saltpetre			I therefore spent a good deal of time in attempting , by a burning - glass , and other means , to impregnate this noxious air with some effluvium of saltpetre , and , with the same view , introduced into it the fumes of the smoaking spirit of nitre ; but both these methods were altogether ineffectual .
rsc6264	effluvium		putrid		Since air which has passed through the lungs is the same thing with air tainted with animal putrefaction , it is probable that one use of the lungs is to carry off a putrid effluvium , without which , perhaps , a living body might putrefy as soon as a dead one .
rsc6264	effluvium	mouse	putrid		This may be owing to the fixed air being transferred from the putrid mouse into the water , and yet it is evident that there is a putrid effluvium entirely distinct from this kind of air , and which has very different properties .

rsc6264	effluvium		putrid		That the putrid effluvium will mix with water seems to be evident from the following experiment .
rsc6264	smell|effluvium|smell		fetid|offensive|putrid|offensive		After a short time , the water contracts an extremely fetid and offensive smell , which seems to indicate that the putrid effluvium pervades the water , and affects the neighbouring air ; and since , after this , there is often no increase of the air , that seems to be the very substance which is carried off through the water , as fast as it is generated ; and the offensive smell is a sufficient proof that it is not fixed air .
rsc6264	pungency		peculiarly pleasing		For this has a very agreeable flavour , whether it be produced by fermentation , or extracted from chalk by oil of vitriol ; affecting not only the mouth , but even the nostrils , with a pungency which is peculiarly pleasing to a certain degree , as any person may easily satisfy himself who will chuse to make the experiment .
rsc6264	effluvium		putrid		If the water in which the mouse was immersed , and which is saturated with the putrid air , be changed , the greater part of the putrid air will , in a day or two , be absorbed , though the mouse continues to yield the putrid effluvium as before ; for as soon as this fresh water becomes saturated with it , it begins to be offensive to the smell , and the quantity of the putrid air upon its surface increases as before .
rsc6264	effluvium	matter	putrid		Since the plants that I made use of manifestly grow and thrive in putrid air ; since putrid matter is well known to afford proper nourishment for the roots of plants ; and since it is likewise certain that they receive nourishment by their leaves as well as by their roots , it seems to be exceedingly probable , that the putrid effluvium is in some measure extracted from the air , by means of the leaves of plants , and therefore that they render the remainder more fit for respiration .

rsc6264	effluvia		noxious		As these agitations were made in jars with wide mouths , and in a trough which had a large surface exposed to the common air , I take it for granted that the noxious effluvia , whatever they be , were first imbibed by the water , and thereby transmitted to the common atmosphere .
rsc6264	smell		disagreeable		In some cases this was sufficiently indicated by the disagreeable smell which attended the operation .
rsc6264	effluvia	matter	noxious		Since , however , water in these experiments must have imbibed and retained a certain portion of the noxious effluvia , before they could be transmited to the external air , I do not think it improbable but that the agitation of the sea and large lakes may be of some use for the purification of the atmosphere , and the putrid matter contained in water may be imbibed by aquatic plants , or be deposited in some other manner .

rsc6264	effluvium		putrid		Having found , by several experiments abovementioned , that the proper putrid effluvium is something quite distinct from fixed air , and finding , by the experiments of Dr .
rsc6264	effluvia		putrid		If fixed air tend to correct air which has been injured by animal respiration or putrefaction , limekilns , which discharge great quantities of fixed air , may be wholesome in the neighbourhood of populous cities , the atmosphere of which must abound with putrid effluvia .
rsc6264	smell	of the volatile spirit of vitriol	very strong		That something proceeding from the brimstone strongly affects the water which is confined in the same place with this brimstone , is manifest from the very strong smell that it has of the volatile spirit of vitriol .
rsc6264	smell	of the volatile spirit of vitriol	very strong		That something proceeding from the brimstone strongly affects the water which is confined in the same place with this brimstone , is manifest from the very strong smell that it has of the volatile spirit of vitriol .
rsc6264	smelled		very offensively		I observed , that when a mixture of this kind was taken out of a quantity of air in which a candle had before burned out , and in which it had stood for several days , it was quite cold and black , as it always becomes in a confined place ; but it presently grew very hot , smoaked copiously , and smelled very offensively ; and when it was cold , it was brown , like the rust of iron .

rsc6264	smell		peculiar		Afterwards I diminished a pretty large quantity of it to one eighth of its original bulk , and the remainder still retained much of its peculiar smell , and diminished common air a little .
rsc6264	smell|impregnated	of nitrous air	peculiar		In this operation the peculiar smell of nitrous air is very manifest , the water being first impregnated with the air , and then transmitting it to the common atmosphere .

rsc6264	impregnating	nitrous air			This experiment gave me the hint of impregnating water with nitrous air , in the manner in which I had before done it with fixed air ; and I presently found that distilled water would imbibe about one tenth of its bulk of this kind of air , and that it acquired a remarkably acid and astringent taste from it .
rsc6264	smell|impregnated	of water	peculiarly pungent		The smell of water thus impregnated is at first peculiarly pungent .
rsc6264	smell|impregnated	of water	peculiarly pungent		The smell of water thus impregnated is at first peculiarly pungent .
rsc6264	impregnation|impregnation				The nitrous air with which I made the first impregnation of water was extracted from copper ; but when I made the impregnation with air from quicksilver , the water had the very same taste , though the matter deposited from it seemed to be of a difF f2 ferent ferent kind ; for it was whitish , whereas the other had a yellowish tinge .
rsc6264	smell		offensive		from 51 / 4 to 31 / 4 ; but not so great as I had expected , the antiseptic power of the nitrous air having checked the tendency to putrefaction ; for when , after a week , I took the mouse out , I perceived , to my very great surprise , that it had no offensive smell .
rsc6264	effluvium|smell		putrid|insufferably offensive		In order to compare the antiseptic power of this kind of air with that of fixed air , I examined a mouse which I had enclosed in a phial full of fixed air , as pure as I could make it , and which I had corked very close ; but upon opening this phial in water , about a month after , I perceived that a large quantity of putrid effluvium had been generated ; for it rushed with violence out of the phial ; and the smell that came from it , the moment the cork was taken out , was insufferably offensive .
rsc6264	smell	of them	the same		The smell of them both was also the same ; so that I concluded it to be the same thing , that part of the nitrous air which is imbibed by water being retained in this solution .

rsc6264	smell		exceedingly pungent		The water over which metals are calcined acquires a yellowish tinge , and an exceedingly pungent smell and taste , pretty much , as near as I can recollect , for I did not compare them together , like that over which brimstone has been frequently burned .
rsc6264	smell	Lime			Lime - water never became turbid by the calcination of metals over it ; but the colour , smell , and taste of the water was always changed , and the surface of it became covered with a yellow pellicle , as before .
rsc6264	impregnation		strong		That water has a considerable affinity with phlogiston , is evident from the strong impregnation which it receives from it .
rsc6264	smell		very disagreeable		It is also less miscible with water , and acquires a very disagreeable smell .
rsc6264	smell		offensive		By continuing upon the surface of the water , it became white , and its offensive smell went off in a few days .

rsc6264	smell		very much		November 6 , 1772 , a quantity of inflammable air , which , by long keeping , had come to extinguish flame , I observed to smell very much like common air in which a mixture of iron filings and brimstone had stood .
rsc6264	smelled		very much		Bismuth and nickel are dissolved in the marine acid with the application of a considerable degree of heat ; but little or no air is got from either of them ; but , what I thought a little remarkable , both of them smelled very much like Harrowgate water .

rsc6264	impregnated				19th , I was called to visit him early in the morning , on account of a bleeding at the nose which had come on : he lost about eight ounces of blood , which was of a loose texture : the haemorrhage was suppressed , though not without some difficulty , by means of tents made of soft lint , dipped in cold water strongly impregnated with tincture of iron , which were introduced within the nostrils quite through to their posterior apertures ; a method which has never yet failed me in like cases .
rsc6264	faetor		peculiar		His stools were less frequent ; their heat likewise and peculiar faetor were considerably diminished : his muttering was much abated , and the subsultus tendinum had left him .
rsc6264	faetor|odour	of his breath|perspiration	unnatural|disagreeable		25th , All the symptoms of putrescency had left him ; his tongue and teeth were clean ; there remained no unnatural blackness or faetor in his stools , which had now regained their proper consistence ; his dozing and muttering were gone off ; and the disagreeable odour of his breath and perspiration was no longer perceived .

rsc617409	smell				de la Condamine had forewarned me , that , when the Indians designed to use their poison ( which , in colour , consistence , and even in smell , has a great deal of resemblance with Spanish liquorice ) they dissolved it in water , and then evaporated it on a slow fire to the consistence of a soft extract .
rsc617409	smell		very penetrating		At the same instant there issued out of this phial a yellowish vapour , of a very penetrating smell , which was soon followed by the extract itself , that spread itself all over the rim of the neck of the bottle .

rsc65616	impregnated ova				by means of impregnated ova conveyed by animals , whether birds or quadrupeds , adhering to some part of their body , such as their feathers or hair , feet or mnouth , - by the latter provided the temperature do not exceed 84 ? or 85 ? ? ? ? And , during rain or snow , are we not warranted in concluding that an ovum may be taken 28 from one river to another without loss of vitality by an Otter or Heron or other aquatic bird , if lodged in the mouth of the one - with the proviso mentioned above , - or in the bill of the other ; or during a time of frost or snow if adhering to the feet of either of the animals mentioned ? When my attention was first given to the subject , which was before I was favoured with your letter , I irnagined that the impregnated ova might be conveyed in the stomach of birds , taken up from one river , and , it might be , disgorged in another , without loss of vitality , inasmuch as the ova of the Salmon found in the stomach of a trout have been known to be productive when returned to water .
rsc62072	smelling				met with a Thunder Storm ; the lightning burnt the Main - top - Sail , split the Main Cap in pieces , rent the mast all along ; There was in Special one dreadful clap of Thunder , in report bigger then of a Great Gun , at which all the Ships company were amazed , then did there fall something from the Clouds , upon the Stern of the Boat , which broke into many small parts , split one of the Pumps : the other Pump much hurt also ; It was a Bituminous matter , smelling much like fired Gun - powder : It continued burning in the Stern of the Boat ; they did with sticks dissipate it , and powred much water on it , and yet they were not able by all that they could doe , to extinguish it , until such time as all the matter was consumed .
rsc65496	smell|smell		pungent		By this means upwards of 135 grains of water were condensed in the cylinder , which had no taste nor smell , and which left no sensible sediment when evaporated to dryness ; neither did it yield any pungent smell during the evaporation ; in short , it seemed pure water .
rsc65496	impregnated				Perhaps too plants growing in the dark may be able to absorb phlogiston from water not much impregnated with dephlogisticated air , but not from water strongly impregnated with it ; and consequently , when kept under water in the dark , may perhaps at first yield some dephlogisticated air , which , instead of rising to the surface , may be absorbed by the water , and , before the water is so much impregnated as to suffer any to escape , the plant may cease to vegetate , unless the water is changed .
rsc65496	impregnated				For this purpose I impregnated some milk of lime with the sumes of burning sulphur , by putting a little of it into a large glass receiver , and burning sulphur therein , taking care to keep the mouth of the receiver stopped till the sumes were all absorbed ; after which the air of the receiver was changed , and more sulphur burnt in it as before , and the process repeated till 122 grains of sulphur were consumed .
rsc65496	impregnated	the distilled water			When this was done , the distilled water was further impregnated in the same manner till the whole of the abovementioned quantity of nitrous air was employed .
