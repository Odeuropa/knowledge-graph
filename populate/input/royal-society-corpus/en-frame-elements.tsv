ro2	Effluvia					out of our Globe					Give me leave here to reflect a little upon the late Aurora Borealis , whose Phenomenon you have so well described and explained in your late Philosophical Transaction , No 347 .	I am of your Opinion , that those Phosphorous or Luminous Appearances in the Firmament , proceed from the various Effluvia perspir ' d out of our Globe , or passing thro ' it ~ for I have seen those Lights over Vesuvius , the Strombulo Islands , and towards Aeina in dark Nights , when those Vulcano ' s were nor firing nor burning , their Sides and Tops being passable to Tra vellers at that time , and all their outward parts quiet .	We are certain that Iceland and Greenland abound with Vulcano ' s ; so may North East Lapland , North Russia and Tartary , where vast Chains of Mountains are said to run .

ro16	smells|smell	it			like Rotten cheese		he			that sweats out of the earth	between a stone and an earth ; but whether the one or the other , made of a mixture ( I guess ) of some Salt or other , and a pure earth without Sulphur , coagulated in the winter , and hardened to perfection by the heats in Summer .	Which Salt Johannes Hessus proves by a very cogent argument to be Alumen liquidum , describing it , as Matthiolus also does p , to be a whitish lacteous substance somewhat inclining to yellow , that sweats out of the earth , and smells like Rotten cheese : whereof having gathered a quantity at Puteoli , together with the other Species ' s of Alum , and kept it a while by him , when he came to look on it again , he found it to have lost the smell , and a great part of it changed into Alumen Plumeum q : the Saline part ( I suppose ) shooting into threads , and the pure earth uniting them , as found in the places wherever generated : whether sweating from the earth as Pliny and Matthiolus would have it r ; or percolated through rocks , as we find it in Wales , the veins of it there running through a rock of stone in hardness and colour not unlike flint ~ .	And yet it seems to be made of much such an Alum as that of John Hessus at Puteoli was , some of it being strawcolour ' d , as if it still retained the yellowness that his liquid bitumen was said to have : which is a colour not given it by any Author , most of it being said to be white or cinereous ; some of it red ; and some of an Iron colour as Agricola tells us t ; and I have some of the Cyprian by me sent from Aleppo by my worthy friend Dr .

In the course of a few minutes the odour of decomposing gun - cotton was perceptible at the opening of the tube ; faint nitrous vapours were soon afterwards observed , and within about fifteen minutes after the first application of heat , the gun - cotten exploded very sharply with only a faint flash , and the tube was shattered and violently dispersed .

Under all circumstances the odour of ammonia , or methylamine , is perceptible on adding potash for the final precipitation of the cotarnine ; and this odour is strongest when a long time has elapsed during the previous parts of the process .	The decomposition which is thus indicated appears to lessen the amount of product obtained in two ways : not only is the quantity of cotarnine existing in the solution diminished by the amount that has suffered decomposition , but the resulting volatile alkali seems to prevent the precipitation of the unaltered base .
ro86	odour	the water									Some steel waters , I believe , contain a large proportion of air , whose elasticity may occasion it to break forth with an explosive force ; some others there are , which contain a volatile and sulphureous halitus ; and to one or other of these two causes , or to some other mineral principle , I think most of the phenomenon may be referred , which have been attributed to a ferrugineous or vitriolic volatile spirit .	As the first thing observable in a mineral water is its outward form , we must therefore take notice , that the water of this Spaw equals the clearest springwater in transparency ; and is likewise as free of any colour or odour : yet its taste is very strong , and may be discerned to be compounded of a sweet , subacid , and astringent taste .	Its sweetness and acidity appear sensibly to arise from alum ; and its high styptic and astringent taste does as evidently proceed from that mineral salt , joined with some earthy or ferrugineous parts .
ro86	vapour		tenuious								This induced me to think , that the mineral parts , which caused the acid and astringent tastes , were mixed in the waters of these two springs in different proportions .	I remember , as I was once carefully observing a large glass full of a chalybeat water , which contained much of this cremor ; soon after it was exposed to the air , I observed a tenuious blueish vapour rising in the parts of the water next the surface , which very much diminished its transparency ; and by degrees this vapour was emitted by the lowest parts of the water : but as the cremor increased on its surface , the water became gradually deprived of the blueish tincture , which it received from this halituous body ; which was apparently nothing else but the parts of the cremor separating from the water , and ascending upwards .	From whence we may conclude , that this cremor consists of the very finest parts of iron attenuated to the highest degree .

The earth drenched by these showers , and acted upon with an intense solar heat as soon as the storm is over , sends forth such noisome vapours as strike the nostrils with a most offensive stench , and occasion bilious vomitings , fluxes , and putrid fevers .	Besides these vapours , which are annual , there appears to be a collection of still more pestiferous matter , confined for a longer time , and issuing from the earth after an interval of five , six , or seven years .

Some of the wards were so free from any smell peculiar to such places , that I am persuaded , were Dr .	Hales ' s design completed , and a person appointed to regulate the sliders of the tubes , and to keep the machine in order , the usual bad consequences from foul and crouded goals , might in a great measure , if not wholly , be prevented in Newgate .

But as it was not my design in this paper to set forth all the advantages , that may be expected from the ventilator , I shall leave that subject to be treated of by the ingenious inventor of it ; and shall only take notice , that the tubes from the several wards , uniting in one great trunk , convey all the putrid steams by that channel into the atmosphere , through a vent made for that purpose in the leads of Newgate ; and that tho ' the wind was moderate during the time we staid in the gaol , yet we observed , that the ventilator lator threw out a considerable stream of air , of a most offensive smell .	Before we parted , Mr .

That soon after happening to open one of the tubes of the old ventilator , which had stood there for three or four years , such an offensive smell issued from it , that being immediately seized with a nausea and sickness at his stomach , he was obliged to go home , and that the night after he fell into a fever , in which he lay about eight days before his friends carried him to the hospital .	That becoming soon delirious , he recollected no other symptom , succeeding these mentioned , besides frequent retchings to vomit , a trembling of his hands , and a constant head - ach .

His mother told us , that some of the journeymen working in Newgate had forced him to go down into the great trunk of the ventilator , in order to bring up a wig , which one them had thrown into it ; and that , as the machine was then working , he had almost been suffocated with the stench , before they could get him up .	That upon coming home he complained of a violent head - ach , a great disorder in his stomach , with retchings to vomit , which had never entirely left him .

It was observable , that before he was taken ill , he had been twice let down into the great trunk of the ventilator , when the machine was standing still , without complaining of any ill smell , or receiving any hurt thereby ; but that the last time , when the machine was working , he immediately cried out he was ready to be suffocated ; and the two men who helped him out , by receiving the foul steam from the trunk , were both set a vomiting so violently as to bring up blood .

I have seen the same species arise from the body of a dead fly , which was become putrid by lying floating for some time in a glass of water , where some flowers had been , in the month of August , 1768 .	This species of Mucor sends forth a mass of transparent filamentous roots , from whence arise hollow stems , that support little oblong - oval seed vessels with a hole on the top of each ; from these I could plainly see minute globular seeds issue forth , in great abundance , with an elastic force , and turn about in the water as if they were animated .

Continuing to view them with some attention , I could just discover , that the putrid water , which surrounded them , was full of the minutest animalcula , and that these little creatures began to attack the seeds of the Mucor for food , as I have observed before in the experiment on the seeds of the larger kind of Fungi or mushrooms .	This new motion continued the appearance of their being alive for some time longer : but soon after many of them arose to the surface of the water , remaining there without motion ; and a succession of them afterwards coming up , they united together in little thin masses , and floated to the edge of the water , remaining there , quite inactive during the time of observation .

ro178	odour				resembled that of wood|that of charcoal		My		during combustion|by digesting the powder|in boiling distilled water		I was , however , soon convinced that the substance of these leaves was not complete charcoal , but might more properly be regarded as vegetable matter in an incipient state of carbonization , which , although possessed of many of the apparent properties of charcoal , still retained a small portion of some of the other principles of the original vegetable .	My suspicion was excited , partly byr the odour produced during combustion , which rather more resembled that of wood than that of charcoal , and partly by the brown solution formed by digesting the powder of the unburned schistus in boiling distilled water ; for , by various tests I ascertained , that the substance thus dissolved was not of a mineral nature .	In order , however , fully to satisfy myself in this respect , I digested 250 grains of the pulverised schistus with six ounces of water .

The powder of the schistus , which had been employed in the preceding experiment , was afterwards digested in alcohol during two days ; and a pale yellow tincture was thus fortmed , which , by evaporation , left about one grain of a yellow transparent substance , possessing the properties of resin .

The quantity , however , which could be extracted from 2oo grains of the coal , by alcohol , was but small , as it did not exceed 3 grains .
ro178	odour		fetid						the combustion of this substance		The quantity , however , which could be extracted from 2oo grains of the coal , by alcohol , was but small , as it did not exceed 3 grains .	But this small quantity was sufficient to prove , that although the Bovey coal does not contain any vegetable extract , like the schistus formerly mentioned , yet the whole of the proximate principles of the original vegetable have not been entirely changed ; as a small portion of true resin , not converted into bitumen , still remains inherent in the coal , although the bituminous part is by much the most prevalent , and causes the fetid odour which attends the combustion of this substance .	Upon a comparison of the general external characters of the Bovey coal , with those of the substance which forms the leaves contained in the Iceland schistus , a very great resemblance will be observed ; and this is farther confirmed , by the similarity of the products obtained from each of them in the preceding experiments , with the single exception , that the leaves contain some vegetable extract , which I could not discover in the Bovey coal .

When applied to the flame of a candle , it burns and melts like sealing - wax , at the same time diffusing an odour which is not disagreeable .	This substance appears to accord in so many properties with the retinasphaltum of Bovey , that I cannot but suspect it to be of a similar nature , and I have little doubt that , by a chemical examination , it will be found to consist partly of resin and partly of bitumen .

The wax in its rough state , is in the form of a coarse pale gray powder , soft to the touch , and mixed with various impurities , consisting chiefly of fibres of the bark of the tree , which , when separated by a sieve , amount to about 40 per cent , It has an agreeable odour , somewhat resembling new hay , but scarcely any taste .	At 2o68 FAHRENHEIT , it enters into perfect fusion , and in this state it may be further purified , by passing it through fine linen .

By this process , it acquires a dirty green colour , and its peculiar smell becomes more evident .	When cold , it is moderately hard and brittle .

ro215	smell	it	unpleasant								The trials which have been made to ascertain its fitness for this purpose , are extremely satisfactory , and when the wick is properly proportioned to the size of the candle , the conm bustion is as perfect and uniform , as that of common bees wax .	The addition of from one - eighth to one - tenth part of tallow , is sufficient to obviate the brittleness of the wax in its pure state , without giving it any unpleasant smell , or materially impairing the brilliancy of its flame .	A mixture of three parts of the vegetable wax , with one part of bees wax , also makes very excellent candles .

Mortimer , dated at Leipsic , March 12 , 1748 , mentions , among other particulars , that if odoriferous substances were included in glass globes and tubes closely stopped , and if these globes were electrised , the smell of the odoriferous substances would as easily as the magnetical power pass through the glass , and be conveyed with the electrical effluvia to considerable distances , upon substances readily conducting electricity : that when a man was electrised with a globe of this sort , the odoriferous matter pervaded his whole body ; and that not only his skin and his cloaths , but his breath , saliva , and sweat , were impregnated with the smell of the substance included in the glass .	That after these globes had been rubbed a few minutes , the flavour 4 of Read June 20 .

Haubold , and others , the smell of the sulphur was perceived at more than ten feet ' s distance , and was so prevalent , that his company was driven away thereby : but that himself staying therein some time longer , his cloaths , his body , and his breath , were infected thereby ; and that this smell even continued upon him the next day .	Moreover upon his repeating this experiment , as he had before found , that sulphur had been useful to him , he on the third day found in his mouth manifest indications of an inflamed blood .

After this he wanted to transmit a pleasant odour ; and for this purpose employed cinnamon , which under the like circumstances sent forth its odour in great abundance ; so that it was not only immediately perceptible to any one entering the chamber , but continued there the next day .	Balsam of Peru , under the like treatment , so impregnated the air of the room , that the cloaths and the breath of the persons therein smelled of the balsam , after having passed through several streets ; and that Mr .

Balsam of Peru , under the like treatment , so impregnated the air of the room , that the cloaths and the breath of the persons therein smelled of the balsam , after having passed through several streets ; and that Mr .

A few days after , when the smell of the chamber was gone off , he conducted a chain upon silk lines from thence through the open air into another chamber quite separate from the former .	In this second chamber he placed a man upon a silk net , who held the chain in his hand , and after having electrised him with the sphere containing balsam of Peru for a quarter of an hour , any person , who was perfectly ignorant of what was doing , would immediately smell the balsam therein .

The man , who was electrised , said , that his tea next morning had a finer taste than usual .
ro220	fragrance	spices|balsams|their							when electrised		23 , 1750 , of which the following is a translation from the Latin of so much as relates to these matters .	You desire me , as soon as the grief for the loss of my wife would permit me , to explain , in the most clear and intelligible manner , my experiments , whereby spices and balsams , by their fragrance , pervade glass , when electrised .	Glass globes and tubes ought to have this property , that , when the latter are rubbed backwards and forwards through the hand , or the former with the hand applied thereto , they give manifest tokens of the electric power .
ro220	odours			the							Glass globes and tubes ought to have this property , that , when the latter are rubbed backwards and forwards through the hand , or the former with the hand applied thereto , they give manifest tokens of the electric power .	Moreover the glass of these tubes and globes ought to be thin ; lest the thickness of the glass should prevent the transmission of the odours .	It is necessary , that the spices be dry , and broken small , and that spirituous liquors , as well as the more liquid balsams , should be well mixed with powdered chalk .
ro220	odoriferous|odoriferous	particles	odoriferous|odoriferous								It is necessary , that the spices be dry , and broken small , and that spirituous liquors , as well as the more liquid balsams , should be well mixed with powdered chalk .	But how great the quantity may be , either of the spices , balsams , or spirituous liquors , which should be included , cannot be determined ; because it is not yet certain , how much of the electrical power is necessary for dissolving the odoriferous particles , and carrying them along with it .	But as the fact itself is manifest , I have taken upon me to transmit to the Royal Society , for which I have the highest regard , two globes and four tubes .
ro220	odours|odour	of the electric matter	plainly different	with a piece of silk or woollen cloth	which		persons		rubbed with a naked but very dry hand		But as the fact itself is manifest , I have taken upon me to transmit to the Royal Society , for which I have the highest regard , two globes and four tubes .	I hope , that these tubes , when rubbed as usual between the hands furnished with a piece of thin and somewhat rough cloth , and that these globes , if mounted upon the pillars of an electrical machine , and either rubbed with a naked but very dry hand , or with a piece of silk or woollen cloth , will transmit odours , plainly different from the odour of the electric matter , and which persons here at Leipsic of good noses have distinctly perceived .	To know indeed this difference , it is necessary , that , before the prepared tube is rubbed , a tube containing nothing odoriferous be tried ; and lest the friction should be attended with no effect , great care must be taken that the outward surface of the globes and tubes be perfectly dry .

To know indeed this difference , it is necessary , that , before the prepared tube is rubbed , a tube containing nothing odoriferous be tried ; and lest the friction should be attended with no effect , great care must be taken that the outward surface of the globes and tubes be perfectly dry .	Of the tubes one contains flowers of sulphur : this was sent me from Dresden by Mr .
ro220	odour		sulphureous			at Dresden	the late Count Saxe	when he was last year			Haubold , mathematician and geographer to the king of Poland .	It is the same sort with one , with which that gentleman showed the late Count Saxe the penetration of the sulphureous odour , when he was last year at Dresden .	In another I have included balsam of Peru , mixed with powdered chalk .
ro220	odour	of the matter	perceptible								The tube , said to contain balsam of Peru and chalk , was about twenty inches long , and 3 / 8 of an inch in diameter : that said to contain opobalsamum was about sixteen inches long , and half an inch in diameter : and that with spirit of wine and chalk was about seventeen inches long , and about half an inch in diameter .	The manner of mounting these globes might be somewhat exceptionable for the purposes intended , as the necks were fitted to their wooden blocks with a resinous cement without glass stoppers ; so that when the globes , from their being rubbed , had warmed the cement , if an odour of the matter contained in the glass had been perceptible , it might have been urged , that it came through the cement with more probability than through the glass : but nothing of this kind could be objected to the tubes , as they were hermetically sealed .	June 12 , 1751 , there met me at my house , in order to make trial of the effects of these glasses , Martin Folks Esq ; President , Nicholas Mann Esq ; Vice - president , Dr .
ro220	smell	of the balsam					Canton|by any of the company				The largest globe , said to contain opobalsamum , was first put the trial : it was first rubbed a considerable time with a dry hand chalked , and the snaps at the prime conductor were but weak ; but upon rubbing the globe , first with the cushion , which I have usually for that purpose employed , and afterwards with red leather , the snaps were much stronger ; and Mr .	Canton , as well as another gentleman present , were electrised by turns therewith : but all this while no smell of the balsam could be perceived by any of the company , either upon the equator of the globe , the persons electrised , the prime conductor , or any of the rubbers made use of ; though for this purpose we carefully observed , not only the method suggested by Mr .	Winkler , but such others , as appeared to us the most conducive to the present purpose .
ro220	smell	the resin					our|we		When the globe was heated		Winkler , but such others , as appeared to us the most conducive to the present purpose .	When the globe was heated , indeed by putting our noses near the mounting , we could smell the resin therein ; but this was all .	We employed quick motion , afterwards we permitted the globe to be still , and then began again with an extremely gentle motion ; but still no odour of the balsam could be perceived in the room , though for that purpose a person was called in , well - skilled in these odours , and who , from his coming fresh out of the air , it was suggested might more readily perceive them : but this , he declared , he was not capable of doing .

We next tried the lesser globe containing cinnamon , and most punctually observed Mr .
ro220	smell	the cinnamon					we		after many trials		We next tried the lesser globe containing cinnamon , and most punctually observed Mr .	Winkler ' s directions , as he is more especially exact in what , he thinks , should be observed to make this experiment succeed : but our endeavours were to no purpose , for we could never , after many trials , either smell the cinnamon , or make the electricity the least perceptible upon the prime conductor .	This indeed was what I had always heretofore observed , when I endeavoured to make this experiment ; as such a quantity of non - electric matter , unless the sides of the globe were very thick , prevented the exciting the electrical power , even when I employed globes much larger than this sent by Mr .
ro220	odour	of the substances	the least				no one of the company		after very many trials		Canton has for some time usually rubbed his tubes with this oiled silk , which he has found by experience to produce the greatest effects , but he does not think it proportionably useful in rubbing globes .	In their turns the globes and all the tubes were rubbed with this oiled silk ; but no one of the company , after very many trials in different ways , could perceive the least odour of the substances contained , either upon the outside of the tubes , or upon the substances electrised thereby .	We thus spent more than two hours without success , in our endeavours to see the effects proposed by Mr .

In the first we are informed , that the effluvia from balsam of Peru were not only perceptible in the person electrised , and in the air of the room ; but that these were carried along with the current of electricity through the open air into another chamber : that his company did not chuse to bear the offensive smell of the brimstone transpiring through his glass ; and that it even heated his own blood : that cinnamon also sent forth its odour in great abundance , perceptible to any one immediately entering the chamber , and continuing there till next day .	In the second letter you will perceive , that there is a great abatement of what we were promised to expect from the first : we are there told , that the glass globes and tubes now sent , if they are electrised , transmit odours , not those directly of the substances included , but such as are plainly different in smell from the electrical effluvia , and which , to use his own words , viri odoratu valentes bic , Lipsiae distinct senserunt ; so that must we conclude , that our noses are not so good as those of the gentlemen at Leipsic ? Mr .

Mr .	Winkler does not even say in his last letter , that he can electrise with the cinnamon - globe , and that the vapours sent from it are to be smelt at the entrance of the chamber ; but that , with a great deal of management , they are to be perceived within an inch or two of the globe ; which however we had the mortification not to be sensible of with the greatest - attention .

Upon the whole , what shall we say ? Shall we believe , that Mr .
ro224	smell	of the Sulphur					I				To satisfy my self upon this point , I took a Glass Ball , the Diameter whereof was almost three inches , with a little hole in it as large as the thickness of a Goose Quill .	In this Glass I put ten Cheese - worms of the largest sort and twice or thrice threw in burning Ggggg2 Brimstone , Brimstone , to the breadth of the back of a Knife , upon a thin slender peice of Hemp ; and observed that the burning Brimstone did not at all injure the Worms , so far as I could see ; and about an hour after the burning of the Sulphur , I put the mouth of the Glass to my Nose , and could still plainly perceive the smell of the Sulphur .	It is well known that when we burn Sulphur , the Sulphur does not perish , but only is divided into such small - particles , as are removed from our view : and accordingly in this experiment I saw an infinite number of very small sulphureous particles , sticking to the inside of the Glass , which appeared to me to be round .
ro227	odour	of the whole							especially when converted into flour		From my experiments I am inclined to believe , that MLust is a taint produced by damp upon the amylaceous part of the grain or starch ; that the portion of starch nearest to the husk is that which is first tainted ; and that the greater or less degree of Must is in proportion to the taint having penetrated more or less into the substance of the grain .	In most cases , howe - ver , the taint is only superficial ; but nevertheless , if not removed , it is sufficient to contaminate the odour and flavour of the whole , especially when converted into flour .	After various experiments , I found the following method to be attended with success .
ro240	smell	it									Washing with clear Water , to make the Hands and Face Black .	Beat Galls into very fine Powder , and strew it very Well and roll it up and down into a Towel , then into a Bason of Water , throw some Roman Vitriol , which will soon dissolve , and after the Party hath washed therein , it being clear and without smell , as soon as they wipe into the Towel all the Skin grows Black .	But in some Days , washing it with Soap , it will come off .
ro256	Smell	The Fir|its							in hot Weather|when it is exposed to the Sun		These must , I think , be very ancient , and have most certainly been made of a raw Hide , by reason they , and the Skin of the Lady , were both of one Colour , and both had one Tanner ; which I presume , is the Moor Water ; which is exactly of the Colour of Coffee ; and made so by reason of such great Quantities of Oak and Fir - Wood , that we frequently dig out of these Moors ; several OakTrees affording 1000 Pales for fencing , five Feet and an half long , and six to eight Inches broad ; which Oak - Wood is rated as black as Jet .	The Fir - Wood retains its Turpentine - Smell , and in hot Weather ( when it is exposed to the Sun ) the Turpentine will drop from it .	This Wood is frequently riven into Laths for the Roofs of Houses or Floors ; and what is remarkable , no Worm will touch them .
ro258	odour	water|ammonia		A gas	something like that of trimethylamine						Small charges and frequent operations are better than acting on large portions .	A gas passes with an odour something like that of trimethylamine ; also water , ammonia ; and finally , a heavy liquid which is not miscible with water .	The residue in the flask contains iodide and carbonate of potassium , paracyanogen , and metallic mercury .
ro258	odour	it	faint|somewhat sweetish|offensive						When pure|when heated with cyanide of potassium		This liquid has the following properties : - It is colourless , highly refractive to light , and almost wholly insoluble in water .	When pure , it has a faint and somewhat sweetish odour , but the crude product is contaminated with the offensive body that always accompanies the decomposition of methyl compounds when heated with cyanide of potassium .	The odour may be entirely removed by agitation with very dilute sulphuric acid .
ro258	odour								may be entirely removed by agitation with very dilute sulphuric acid		When pure , it has a faint and somewhat sweetish odour , but the crude product is contaminated with the offensive body that always accompanies the decomposition of methyl compounds when heated with cyanide of potassium .	The odour may be entirely removed by agitation with very dilute sulphuric acid .	This liquid is very combustible , and burns with a luminous flame and abundant evolution of mercurial vapour .
ro258	odour	mercury|paracyanogen|gaseous matters	offensive						the heat employed		Although little less than one pound of iodide of mercurous ethyl was digested with cyanide of potassium , the distillate obtained was too small in quantity to permit of more than a general examination .	The greater part of the new body is resolved by the heat employed into mercury , paracyanogen , and gaseous matters , of an offensive odour .	The product in the receiver was distilled in a water - bath until all iodide of ethyl was driven off .
ro261	stinking|stinking vapours|vapours		stinking|stinking	vapours|vapours				the two first days			This is what I will not answer for the truth of , not having received sufficient information in that respect .	At two leagues distance from Stolberg there was formed an opening of about twenty feet long , and several feet deep , from which , it is affirmed , there arose the two first days stinking vapours : but it filled up of itself , and is now almost entirely closed .	This is the fact , which has been so much exaggerated in the Gazettes .
ro263	smell		strong sulphureous|disagreeable					sometimes	In approaching this Cape		From the sea it appears a mass of black vitrified rocks ; but , on a close examination , it is found a composition of bituminous scoriae , vitrified sand , and earth , cemented together ; in some parts beds of cinders only are found .	In approaching this Cape , there is a strong sulphureous smell , sometimes disagreeable .	This smell is prevalent in many parts of the ground to the distance of eight or ten miles from it .
ro263	smell					in many parts of the ground					In approaching this Cape , there is a strong sulphureous smell , sometimes disagreeable .	This smell is prevalent in many parts of the ground to the distance of eight or ten miles from it .	This point of land is about two miles broad , and on the east and west sides , from the distance of about half a mile from the sea , falls with a gentle declivity to it , and is joined to the main land on the south by the continuation of the Mangrove swamps ; so that the bituminous plain is on the highest part of it , and only separated from the sea by a margin of wood which surrounds it , and prevents a distant prospect of it .
ro263	smelt|smells|smell	sulphur|its	very strong|very different|easily distinguished|the nearest to		that of pitch	over many parts of it|from some parts of the adjacent woods	I|I				As to its depth , I can form no idea of it ; for in no part could I find a substratum of any other substance ; in some parts I found calcined earth mixed with it .	Although I smelt sulphur very strong on passing over many parts of it , I could discover no appearance of it , or any rent or crack through which the steams might issue ; probably it was from some parts of the adjacent woods : for although sulphur is the basis of this bituminous matter , yet the smells are very different , and easily distinguished , for its smell comes the nearest to that of pitch of any thing I know .	I could make no impression on its surface without an axe : at the depth of a foot I found it a little softer , with an oily appearance , in small cells .
ro263	smells	This	stronger|strongly		of tar						Besides this place , where it is found in this solid state , it is found liquid in many parts of the woods ; and at the distance of twenty miles from this about two inches thick , round holes of three or four inches diameter , and often at cracks or rents .	This is constantly liquid , and smells stronger of tar than when indurated , and adheres strongly to any thing it touches ; grease is the only thing that will divest the hands of it .	The soil in general , for some distance round La Bray , is cinders and burnt earths ; and where not so , it is a strong argillaceous soil ; the whole exceedingly fertile , which is always the case where there are any sulphureous particles in it .
ro264	smell	Pure iron|of hydrogen	instant						if dipped into water|only exposed to the atmosphere		Nor can this be considered an unnatural result to those who consider the characters of iron .	Pure iron in the form of a sponge takes fire spontaneously in the air ; and a plate recently cleansed if dipped into water , or breathed upon , or only exposed to the atmosphere , produces an instant smell of hydrogen .	The thin film of oxide which can form during a momentary exposure is , therefore , quite enough to account for the electric current produced .
ro266	smell	of this gas|of	more suffocating								A mixture of equal parts of these gases , previously dried over mercury , being exposed to bright sunshine for about one quarter of an hour , lost all colour of the chloric gas , and were found condensed into half their former volume .	The smell of this gas was more suffocating than that of chlorine .	It occasioned a very painful sensation in the eyes ; it reddened litmus paper ; it combined with ammonia , forming a salt perfectly neutral and dry , but deliquescent by attracting moisture from the atmosphere .
ro268	smelling	inquadrupeds									.	Wherever we find the subsistence or safety of an animal , entrusted to , or depending more particularly upon one sense than the rest , we are sure to find that sense proportionably perfect ; - as inquadrupeds the organ of smelling is remarkably perfect , and leads them to their prey , so the eyes of birds are proportionably perfect , being the means not only of their support , but from them they receive the first intimation of approaching danger .	The eyes of birds , like those of other animals , consist of three coats , the sclerotica , choroides , and retina .

THE Hunter in a clear Sun - shiny day , takes a Plate or Trencher , with a little Sugar , Honey or Molosses spread on it , and when got into the Woods , sets it down on a Rock or Stump in the Woods : this the Bees soon scent and find out ; for it is generally supposed a Bee will scent Honey or Wax above a Mile ' s distance .	The Hunter secures in a Box or other Convenience , one or more of the Bees as they fill themselves , and after a little time , lets one of them go , observing very carefully the Course the Bee steers ; for after he rises in the Air , he flies directly , or upon a straight Course to the Tree where the Hive is .

Coal - tar naphtha has the advantage that it is a mobile liquid , does not dissolve most salts , and does not resinify in contact with the air ; but besides the disagreeable odour , with continuous working , respiring air charged with its vapour appears to act injuriously on the organs of the voice .	As compared with water , coal - tar naphtha has the disadvantage , that its specific heat must be specially determined , and any possible uncertainty in this is transferred to the determination of the specific heat of the solid substance ; but the thermal action of a given volume of naphtha is only about that of the same volume of water * ; and in experiments in which the thermal action of a solid substance is ' determined , along with that of the necessary quantity of liquid which is contained with that substance in a glass , the thermal action due to the solid is a larger fraction of the total if coal - tar naphtha is used than if water is the liquid , which is a favourable circumstance in the accurate determination of specific heat .

And upon this account , it is very advisable after the Cure is once performed , still to continue the Anointing for a day or two more ; which it is the easier to do , because these Liniments may be made agreeable enough , and of a good smell , as particularly is that compounded of the Ointment of Orange Flowers or Roses , and a small quantity of red Praecipitate .

Though his Gums and Fauces were very sore and swoln , he scarce spit One Pint in 24 Hours , and that excessively tough and fetid .

This was done for Three Days successively : Notwithstanding which , though his Chaps grew exceeding sore , and his Throat so much inflamed and pained , that he swallowed with extreme Difficulty what he sucked through a Pipe or Quill , yet the Spitting was very little increased , and as tough as ever : Nor did the fistulous Ulcers seem in the least disposed to heal up , but vented a vast Deal of stinking , oily , sanious Matter ; nay , even new ones broke out under each Axilla , and a very large Phyma rose on the Coccyx , which soon discharged the same kind of virulent Matter ; though we found the Bone , and even the Periosteum , quite sound and untouched .	The Scales were now grown so hard and stiff , that he could scarce bend a Limb , or Finger : Moreover , Abundance of Ulcers , from whence flowed great Quantities of greasy , purulent , and somewhat bloody Matter , were broke out in his Thighs and Buttocks .

I now unfortunately found , though too late , there was nothing to be done by Mercury in any Form ; and therefore determined to run it off , and try the Guaiacum Method and Sweating , so much recommended of old ( and in some Cases so justly ) by Sir Ulric Hutton , and others ; at the same time keeping up a most plentiful Dilution , attempting withal to detach the scaly Cuticule by continued emollient Baths , which at the same time also would partly act by Dilution .

It never grows bigger than a Man ' s Leg , nor taller than Alder , but spreads much , and several together , especially about the Stump or Roots of one that is cut down ; as it is of quick growth , so it does not last long ; the inside of the Wood is yellow and very full of Juice , as glutinous as Honey or Turpentine ; the Wood itself has a very strong unsavoury Smell , but the Juice stinks as bad as Carrion .

The liquid in this state , however , was objectionable , in a practical as well as a scientific point of view , on account of its colour , odour , and indeterminate strength .	It therefore became desirable to attempt the formation of some definite salt , of analogous composition , which , by solution in water , should form a decomposing agent , of a strength which might at all times be depended on ; capable also of being varied according to circumstances .

The 16th of January was a very temperate Day , with a gentle Breeze between South and West : A little after Twenty - four Hours ( about Six at Night , according to our English way of reckoning ) I observed a certain dark Cloud , which passed with a bad Smell ; of this I took but little Notice , having often smelt the like ; and what might occasion a a greater Inobservance , was , a great Cold , which prevented my distinguishing between Smells , whether good or bad : However , I saw this Cloud , blacker and thicker than the rest , settle within a Foot and an half on the Tops of the Houses , like the Smoke that the Peasants make in an Evening , when they burn their Garden Rubbish , or such - like .	On account of the Cold I had , and this black Cloud , I went into a Friend ' s House : Finding him with Company , after a little common discourse , he returned , it being Tuesday , and I remained with a few more , At Two Hours in the Night , ( Eight o ' Clock English ) we thought the Pavement gave way , and the Chamber shook : Some of us thought it proceeded from walking in another Chamber , others thought it was a Shock of an Earthquake ; upon which I listened attentively , to hear if there might be any consequent Motion or Noise in the House , that I could attribute it too ; but on the contrary every thing was quite still : Upon this I went to the Window , and found a small Air from the South ; the dark Cloud was no longer to be seen , but a thin slight Obscurity in the Air .

This being the first accident of this nature , those without ran , in a great amazement , with their candles in their hands , to see what the matter was ; which were twice extinguished , but heldin upon the third lighting : They saw nothing , but met with an intolerable stench of brimstone , and an heat as scalding as an Oven half heated ( for that was their expression ; ) which forced them very speedily to quit the place .	Notwithstanding this , they wrought forwards for about three weeks , and carried it on to betwixt thirty and forty yards , until one Henry Turnelly met with the same accident , which had formerly befallen Michell , and Michell had also the misfortune to have his share in this : For , being by chance under ground , at the mouth of the Bink , he was shot forth for about two or three yards , and had his head broken , and his body bruised against the further side .

I took up about a score of them , and put them into a Box , but they immediately offended me with an ungrateful and strong stink , which yet is not usual to the Caterpillar kind .	However I kept them 2 days , but by reason of some Apprehensions and fear the Ladies had of them , where I sojourned , and upon their entreaties I rid my self of them ; I only observed , that the Excrements which they voided , were little hard Pellets of pure white flower , like that of Barly .
ro402	smell	of chlorine							When the triple compound is thrown into concentrated 488 muriatic acid		The triple compound dissolves without decomposition in solution of phosphorous acid ; but on heating the solution , oxygene is attracted by it , iodine appears , and phosphate of potassa is formed .	When the triple compound is thrown into concentrated 488 muriatic acid , there is an effervescence , the smell of chlorine is perceived , the fluid becomes yellow , and when evaporated yields the chlorionic acid .	When the solution of the hydroionic acid in water is poured upon the triple salt , iodine is instantly produced in great quantities .
ro402	smell	of sulphurous acid gas									I have attempted to obtain pure triple compounds from solutions of baryta and lime , and from magnesia diffused through water , by dissolving iodine in them by heat , and by evaporating the clear liquor until it began to deposit crystals .	In this way I have procured substances which , when well washed in distilled water , afforded no iodine to nitric acid , which yielded chlorine and chlorionic acid when acted upon by muriatic acid , and which when distilled afforded much oxygene and some iodine , and left substances which appeared to be mixtures of the earths with compounds that afforded iodine to sulphuric acid , producing a smell of sulphurous acid gas , and which probably consisted of the metals of the earths united to iodine .	The triple compounds from lime and magnesia were soluble without affording iodine in sulphuric acid ; but on evaporating the acid , at the time that the vessel of platinum in which the experiment was made b - came dry and almost red hot , the violet vapour was perceived .

But in those asses to which the rhubarb boluses had been given without any fluid , the spleen was found in its contracted state , with cells scarcely visible , and without sensible impregnation by the rhubarb ; but the caecum and colon contained several quarts of fluid , in which the rhubarb was more evident both to sight and smell than in the stomach .	The urine also was highly impregnated with the colour of the rhubarb .

That urine does contain sulphur , not in combination as sulphate , is evident from the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen which , mixed with that of ammonia , is evolved from it whilst undergoing spontaneous decomposition , also frbom the blackening which white lead paint suffers when exposed to the gases arising from putrid ur ' ine , and likewise from the fact , that urine allowed to putrefy in a glass vessel containing oxide of lead as one of its contituents , permanently blackens the glass .	To set the fact beyond doubt , two portions of urine , previously deprived of mucus by acetic acid and filtration , each consisting of four fluid ounces , were measured ; the one simply evaporated and burnt , the other evaporated and afterwards deflagrated with nitre .

Readily soluble in alcohol , and still more so in ether , at any temperature ; the solubility , in either instance , greatly increased by increase of temperature .
ro412	odour	of			closely resembles that of the oil				by exposure to light		Of the four several substances which result from the distillation of the black liquid described in the former part of this paper , it is probable that the water and the yellow farina are the only real products , and that the others are mere educts of that distillation : for , with respect to the water , its proportion is variable according to the greater or less degree of rapidity with which the distillation is conducted ; and if it were present as water in the black liquid , there is reason to believe it would be found supernatant on its surface , after having remained still for some time .	The essential liquid oil , and the white concrete substance , which pass over during the distillation , are probably contained originally in that thin portion of the black liquid which may be filtered through unsized paper ; for the odour of this filtered portion closely resembles that of the oil ; and the oil , by exposure to light , frequently becomes of a darker and darker shade , so as at last to be nearly of a deep brown colour ; and , with respect to the white concrete substance , this was lot only found crystallized in that part of the original apparatus where the black liquid was condensed , but has been obtained from that liquid by simple evaporation of it at the common temperature of the atmosphere .	The yellow farina is probably produced from the tar which is contained in the proportion of about one - fourth in the black liquid ; for it does not make its appearance till towards the end of the distillation ; when the more volatile substances have ceased to pass over , and the heat has been increased to the utmost : and if common coal tar be exposed to a low red heat , it will be found , that when the tar has o0 been nearly evaporated , this yellow farina will begin to pass off It remains for me to propose a name for the white concrete substance which has been described in this paper : and , unless a more appropriate term should be suggested by others , I would propose to call it naphthaline .

ro417	olfactory|olfactory|olfactory|olfactory|olfactory	Cems	olfactory|olfactory|olfactory|olfactory								Close as we now stand to the Mammal , it is yet very hard to see the exact bearings of this subject : the present Hunterian Professor of Anatomy did once , with his keener insight , give the writer a clue to trace its mazes by ; it has , however , required much persistent work to make it clear .	The hole through which the olfactory Cems of the bird passes out of the cranium into the orbit , is not a single representative of the many pores through which the olfactory filaments of the Mammal pass ; the membrane which encloses that crus is really part of the skull - floor ; and the chink through which the olfactory crus passes anteriorly , between the aliethmoid and the perpendicular plate , is the homologue of that vertical series of passages which lies nearest the crista galli of the Mammal .	In the bird this chink is not subdivided , and the crus passes inz to give off its filaments from its dilated end .
ro417	olfactory|olfactory	crura	olfactory|olfactory								In the bird the cranial cavity is aborted anteriorly by the upgrowth of the great interorbital septum ; the crista galli underprops the frontals directly , and the posterior end of the middle ethmoid ( above ) goes far back to join the presphenoid .	On the latter the olfactory crura rest ; the sides of the former ( the supero - posterior part of the middle ethmoid ) are grooved to lodge them as they pass mesiad of , and over the large eyeballs to reach their destination .	The posterior margin of the pars plana is thick and turned inwards , and stands upwards and a little backwards ; nearly all its inner surface is occupied with an ovoidal tent - like outgrowth ( Plate XII .
ro417	olfactory|olfactory	wings	olfactory|olfactory								"As in the other "" 1 Struthionid & amp ; "" and the Mammalia , there is a perfect continuity of all the nasal cartilages ; the alp that grow from the upper edges of the great general orbito - nasal septum being converted into cartilage by the metamorphosis of the whole of its simple cells , without any of that breaking up into distinct territories which we see in the purer bird - types ."	These upper olfactory wings extend on each side for a distance of 1 inch 8 lines , the whole length of the skull and face being 2 inches and 8 lines ; for the hinder end of the upper ethmoid lies in the same vertical line as the common optic foramen , and the ale nasi fill up the angle of the intermaxillaries on each side ( Plate X .	figs .

The position of this tent is oblique , for it passes downwards and forwards ; a valley of the same breadth as this turbinal separates it from the enfolded upper turbinal ; below this true olfactory region lies the hinder part of the inferior turbinal ( Plate X .	fig .

"There is a large notch in the lower edge of the orbital plate of the frontal ; but this is made into a large irregular foramen by the immediate contiguity of the upper edge of the simple cribriform plate ; this is the "" 1 upper orbital fontanelle ; "" and at this part the olfactory crus is only protected externally by membrane ."	There is no such open space in the skull of the adult African Ostrich , and in the Rhea it is only large enough to allow the olfactory crus to escape into the orbit , along which it passes to gain the noncribriform chink between the vertical ethmoid and its ala .

ro419	effluvia	by a brush of green elder leaves	disagreeable|offensive				to our olfactory nerves				& amp ; c .	1st , I was led to my first experiments , by considering how disagreeable and offensive to our olfactory nerves the effluvia emitted by a brush of green elder leaves are , and from thence , reasoning how much more so they must be to those of a butterfly , whom I considered as being as much superior to us in delicacy as inferior in size .	Accordingly I took some twigs of young elder , and with them whipped the cabbage plants well , but so gently as not to hurt them , just as the butterflies first appeared , from which time , for these two summers , though the butterflies would hover and flutter round them like gnomes or sylphs , yet I could never see one pitch , nor was there I believe a single catterpiller blown , after the plants were so whipped ; though an adjoining bed was infested as usual .

While the Cloth so writ upon , lies in the Sun , it will yield a very strong fetid smell ; ( which divers who have smelt it could not endure , ) as if Garlic & amp ; Assa - faetida were mixed together : which I proved but few days before I wrote this , though it had been at least twelve months , kept in a Book , and before it was laid in the Sun , had very little of that smell .	I have farther observed , that the cloth dried and washed , soon after it is wrote on , will appear fresher & amp ; brighter , then after being long kept in a Book ; as I found by some I newly caused to be washed , after they had been 14 months so kept .

I have repeated Marignac ' s and Schunck ' s experiments of distilling a mixture of phthalic acid and lime ; and , like both of these chemists , I observed a quantity of very aromatic benzol to be produced , which , by the action of strong nitric acid , readily yielded nitrobenzol , and from this , by the action of reducing agents , aniline .

If the Motion of a Superficies of 30 Miles Diameter was owing to Fumes and Vapours , we ought reasonably to find some great Discharge of them , like a Coal - Pit fired : The Operation of it ought to be Hours and Days in Continuance , not instantaneous : And the Evaporation of such a Quantity of inflammable Matter requires a long time to evacuate itself .

One of the surgeon ' s mates dressed a blister on the back of a soldier , ill of the disorder , with a digestive softened with oil of turpentine : having done , he came into the surgery , and looked quite pale , telling me , That the soldier ' s back had smelled so putrid and offensive , that it had made him quite faint and sick at the stomach .	He took some tincture of bark and bitters , and went home , when a fever , with a train of the worst symptoms , made its appearance in the evening , and he died the third day .

In descending the series from Man to the Placental Mammals of lowest cerebral organization , the great change in the condition of the corpus callosum has been seen to be , the disappearance of the rostral portion , and the coincident greater development of the posterior folded or psalterial portion ; the latter being connected with the relative increase of the hippocampal region of the cerebrum .

Then we clipped off as much of the Bladder at the neck , as was judged absolutely necessary to make an Orifice capable of letting in a Mouse ; that sort of Animals being , by reason of their smallness , the fittest of those furnished with Lungs and hot blood , we could procure .

I know , there are some Corrosive Spirits , as in Nitre and Salt , simple , or compounded of them , that , when they are very strong , emit for a while manifest fumes ; but the difference of those Liquors , and their inferiority to our red Spirit , in the Capacity of smoaking Liquors , might easily enough be manifested , if it were judged proper in this place , where it may suffice , to take notice of these two things : The one is , That when the Viol has lain stopped and quiet a competent time , the upper half of it will appear destitute of fumes , of which the Air , it seems , will imbibe , and constantly retain but a certain moderate quantity , which may give some light towards the Reason , Why the same Air , which will be quite clogged with steams , will not long serve for Respiration , which requires frequent supplies of fresh Air : The other is , That if the unstoppd Viol were placed in our Vacuum , it would not emit any visible steams at all , nor so much as to appear in the upper part of the Glass it self that held the Liquor ; whereas , when the Air was by degrees restored at the stopcock , without moving the Receiver it self , to avoid injuring its closeness , the returning Air would presently raise the fumes , first into the vacant part of the Viol , whence they would ascend into the Capacity of the Receiver ; and likewise , when the Air , that was requisite to support them , was pumped out , they also accompanied it , as their unpleasant smell evinced , and the red Spirit , though it remained unstopped , emitted no more fumes till the new Air was let in .	One may compare with this Liquor another Smoaking one , mentioned in the 29th of the first published Pneumatical Experiments , where an Experiment is related of it , that has something in common with this , and may so far serve to confirm what is now delivered , as this also has some things additional to that : Besides that that Liquor being made with Ingredients Corrosive , and of a bad name among Chymists themselves , the fumes , that proceed from it , may fright many from daring to meddle with it : whereas this our red Spirit has been found potently medicinal for some distempers of the Lungs by a Dr .

C .	the colour darkens , and a small quantity of a yellowish liquid of a penetrating odour , free from zincethyl and possessing a very powerful alkaline reaction , distils over .	This liquid , neutralized with hydrochloric acid and treated with bichloride of platinum , yielded a splendidly crystalline platinum salt , which was obtained , however , in too small quantity to allow of its composition being determined .
ro623	odour		ethereal	The gas							In order to ascertain the exact nature of the gas evolved in this reaction , some crystals of dinitroethylate of zinc and zincethyl were passed up into an inverted receiver filled with mercury , and were then brought into contact with a small quantity of water .	The gas thus collected over mercury possessed an ethereal odour , burnt with a slightly luminous flame , and was completely soluble in an equal volume of alcohol .	It was perfectly neutral , and underwent no change on being treated successively with caustic potash solution and dilute sulphuric acid .

Dilute dinitroethylic acid thus prepared possesses a pungent odour , somewhat resembling that of the nitro - fatty acids , and an acid taste .	It reddens litmus - paper strongly , and gradually decomposes even at ordinary temperatures .

When crystallized , dinitroethylate of lime is distilled with sulphovinate of potash , alcohol comes over mixed with an ethereal liquid which dissolves in water , but separates again on the addition of chloride of calcium , in the form of oily drops of a peculiar ethereal odour .	I only succeeded , however , in obtaining such minute quantities of this body as to preclude the possibility of fixing its composition .

About Lebadia , and all through Baeotia , the Plains are very fertile , and make amends for the barrenness of the Hills which encompass them : But in Winter they are apt to be overflown for that reason , and to be turned into Lakes ; which renders the Baeotiar Air very thick , and so were their Skulls too , if the Ancients may be believed concerning them ; though Pindar , who was one that sublimated Poetry to its highest exaltation , and is much fancied and imitated in our Age , as he was admired in his own , was born there : And Amphion , who was said to be so divine in his Music , that he ravished the very stones , had skill enough to entice them to make up the Walls of Thebes : So that not every thing that ' s born in a dull Air , isdull .

It commonly 74 shows traces of the presence of ammonia , changing vegetable blues to green , and smoking when brought near muriatic acid ; but this minute portion of ammonia is probably only accidentally present .
ro666	Scent	of Meat	strong								MR .	Stallwood , a Farmer at Hackney , informed the Justices , to whom the Care of the distemper ' d Cattle was committed , that he had buried thirteen Cows very deep , with the Quantity of Lime appointed by the Justices ; and , observing his Dogs to scratch and tear up the Ground with their Feet , to get at the Cows Flesh ( the Lime fermenting , and causing a Foam , as he called it , or strong Scent of Meat to arise , which made the Dogs so eager to come at it ) he beat them off several times : But the Dogs always returning as soon as he was gone , he , for some time , hired Boys to keep them off .	But that he had buried several other Cows in another Place , with their Hides cut and flashed , without any Lime ( being ordered by the Justices so to do ) , and the Dogs never attempted to scratch or tear up the Ground there , though it lay open to them equally with the other Ground , and they often run over it .

Di - isopropyl is a colourless mobile liquid , the odour of which cannot be distinguished from that of hydride of hexyl , and which boils constantly at 58 ? C .

I must confess , this gland did not seem to me , to have that offensive smell ; or to impress it on the flesh .

If the appearance to the eye should fail to convince any person of this , the sense of smell would do it : for even in a glass vessel it is very offensive , though it might not be pronounced to be acid .

The farmer ' s daughter received the shock in the hall ( at 7 ) ; was struck senseless , but revived soon ; felt a trembling all over ; her feet tickling , and partly benumbed , and stiff , as if sleeping ; but perceiving in the room a cloud of smoke , and hearing her mother cry , she made haste into the kitchen , which she found full of smoke , stinking like brimstone .	The lightning had left a mark quite cross the clavel of the kitchen - chimney , about half an inch wide , in an undulating direction , broke thro ' the partitions of the under - floor , thrown down the shelves , carried out all the south windows , forced up the stair - case , blown out the north window ( 10 ) , missed or spared a clock , which stood close by the window ( at 11 ) ; and being somewhat spent , when it reached the hall ( 7 ) , carried out the windows ; moved not some Delft basons , which were in the south window , but forced the door of a beaufet ( 14 ) , at the end of the hall , an inch and a half inwards ; and shook the eastern wall of the house to the very foundation .

The introduction of the gas lights into this manufactory has been gradual : at first some inconvenience was experienced from the smell ; but this objection has been wholly removed by improved methods of purifying the gas , and it is now much approved by the work - people for the perfect steadiness of the light ; and it is wholly free from the inconvenience of snuffing , and from the danger occasioned by sparks that fall from candles .	In addition to the foregoing statement of comparative economy , the author conceives it may be interesting to the Society to be informed of the original application of this gas , as a substitute for oil and tallow , which he states to have put in practice nearly sixteen years , in consequence of experiments which he was at that time conducting at Redruth , in Cornwall , upon the distillation of various mineral and vegetable substances .

ro767	smell	of volatile alkali				from substances	PRIESTLEY		in		In this undertaking I also derived much assistance from the ingenious labours of Dr .	PRIESTLEY ; who , in the course of his experiments , had been repeatedly struck with the smell of volatile alkali from substances not supposed to contain it , and had pointed out some important phenomenon attending its production .	But having acquired a more perfect knowledge of its constituent parts , I was enabled to produce volatile alkali in a more simple manner , and more demonstrative of its elements , than he had done .
ro767	smell	of volatile alkali	very pungent								In this experiment a few ounces of powdered tin are moistened with some moderately strong nitrous acid , and after they have stood together a minute or two , about half an ounce of fixed alkali is mixed with them .	A very pungent smell of volatile alkali is immediately perceived .	The experiment succeeds equally , if lime be used instead of fixed alkali .
ro767	smell	Nitrous acid|cupreous nitre|sulphur|of volatile alkali							mixed|kept in a close vessel for some hours		Any person , who moistens a drachm or two of filings of zinc with a solution of cupreous nitre , and , after they begin to act on each other , adds to them a little salt of tartar , will find volatile alkali to be produced .	Nitrous acid , or cupreous nitre , mixed with iron filings , sulphur , and a little water , and kept in a close vessel for some hours , yields a smell of volatile alkali ; and if a piece of paper , stained with a vegetable blue substance , be thrown into the vessel , it will , in a short time , be turned to a green colour .	In each of these experiments the nitrous acid and the water are decomposed .
ro768	putrid|putrid|putrid	salts|putrid|putrid|putrid matter	putrid|putrid|putrid								THE agriculture society at Manchester has long recommended the making of reservoirs for the water which flows from dung - hills in farm yards .	This water is strongly impregnated with the salts and putrid matter of the dung - hill , and by stagnation it acquires a much higher degree of putrescence , and probably becomes proportionably more replete with salts .	When thus collected and improved , it is pumped into an hogshead , which being drawn upon a sledge , or small cart , is conveyed into the meadows , for the purpose of sprinkling them with this rich manure .
ro768	smell	of volatile alkali							either in a solid form , dissolved , or when added to lime - water		To the taste it is acrid , saline , and sulphureous .	It emits no smell of volatile alkali , either in a solid form , dissolved , or when added to lime - water ; neither does it communicate the sapphire colour to a solution of blue vitriol .	Silver is quickly tinged black by it , a proof that it contains much phlogiston .
ro768	ferment		so strong							almost instantly excites putrefaction	At Hart Hill , my summer abode , about three miles from Manchester , I have lately practised a method of making a compost of the dung - hill water .	The weeds and rakings of the garden , the dressings of the fields , the leaves blown from the trees , and other refuse matters , are put together near the reservoir , out of which the water is occasioally pumped and scattered over the heap : so strong a ferment almost instantly excites putrefaction .	And these vegetable substances are soon converted into a fertile mould , which retaining the salts and oils of the dunghill water , suffers the superfluous moisture to exhale into the air , or to percolate through it .

In the second part of his paper the author gives an account of a course of experiments which he made with a view to discover the influence of colour on the absorption of odorous effluvia , and more especially in the case of the absorption of the fumes of camphor and assafoetida by woollen cloth of different colours .	Black cloth was always found to be possessed of the greatest absorbing powers , and white of the least ; red cloth being intermediate between them .

This signification of his Seminal and Fermental principles he illustrates by the Generation both of Vegetables and Animals ; esteeming the said generation to be no other than a natural Evolution or Expansion of the implanted Seminal principles contained in the minute Seed or Embrio , and rendred fruitful or prolific by the odour of a spirituous ferment .	So that these Seminal Principles , carried on by a mutual collision of Mechanical Agents , are , to him , the very groundwork of all natural Fire in bodies , and that these little Fires , harboured in so many minute portions of Matter as there are variety of things , give motion and vigour to every body wherewith they are cloathed .

Under the blow - pipe it may be distinguished from uric acid by the smell , which at no period resembles that of prussic acid ; but in addition to the usual smell of burned animal substances , there is a peculiar foetor , of which I cannot give a correct idea , as I know no smell which it can be said to resemble .	This species of calculus is so readily acted upon by the generality of common chemical agents , that its character may perhaps be most dihtinctly marked , by an enumeration of those feeble powers that it can resist .

On cooling , the liquid solidifies into a crystalline mass , which is insoluble in water , soluble in alcohol and ether , and crystallizes from the latter solvent in beautiful little square tables , tasteless , inodorous , and infusible at 100 ? C .	On submitting this compound to analysis , I was surprised to find that it contained no phosphorus , and that it exhibited the composition of the original cyanate of phenyl , from which it differs so essentially in its properties .

From a concentrated solution , the base is separated without change ; but when dilute and hot solutions are employed , the turbidity at first produced disappears , and after a few minutes beautiful crystals of phenyl - sulphocarbamide ( C , , H8 N2 S2 ) make their appearance ; at the same time the odour of triethylphosphine becomes perceptible .	With potassa the deportment is perfectly analogous , but the crystals formed after some time are diphenyl - sulphocarbamide ( sulphocarbanilide , C2 HI , 1 N , S2 ) instead of phenyl - sulphocarbamide .

Robert May smelled a most terrible Smell of Sulphur , both before and after the Wind passed him , and heard the Noise a great while after seeing the Smoke , before he saw the Wind , an Hedge intercepting his Sight .

Mankind in general are sensible that nothing is more disagreeable , or more pestiferous , than putrid substances ; and it is apparent to all who have made observation , that those little insects contribute more to the quick dissolution and dispersion of putrescent matter than any other .	They are so necessary in all hot climates , that even in the open fields a dead animal or small putrid substance cannot be laid upon the ground two minutes before it will be covered with Flies and their Maggots , which instantly entering quickly devour one part , and perforating the rest in various directions , expose the whole to be much sooner dissipated by the elements .

On these accounts we are careful to set all our chests and boxes upon stones or bricks , so as to leave the bottoms of such furniture some inches above the ground ; which not only prevents these insects finding them out so readily , but preserves the bottoms from a corrosive damp which would strike from the earth through , and rot every thing therein : a vast deal of vermin also would harbour under , such as Cock - roaches , Centipedes , Millepedes , Scorpions , Ants , and various other noisome insects .

By double decomposition the other compounds of stanethylium can be readily formed ; the author has prepared and described the oxide , chloride , bromide and sulphide of stanethylium ; these bodies exhibit a striking resemblance to the corresponding bi - compounds of tin , but are distinguished from them by a peculiar pungent and irritating odour resembling that of the volatile oil of mustard .

I was taking an Observation on the Quarterdeck , about ten Minutes before 12 o ' Clock : One of the Quarter - masters desired I would look to Windward , which I did , and observed a large Ball of blue Fire rolling on the Surface of the Water , at about Three Miles Distance from us : We immediately lowered our Topsails , and had our Fore and Main Clew - Garnets manned to haul up our Courses ; but it came down upon us so fast , that before we could raise the Main Tack , we observed the Ball to rise almost perpendicular , and not above forty or fifty Yards from the Main Chains : It went off with an Explosion as if Hundreds of Cannon had been fired at one time ; and left so great a Smell of Brimstone , that the Ship seemed to be nothing but Sulphur .	After the Noise was over , which I believe did Read March did not last longer than half a Second ; we looked over head , and found our Maintopmast shattered into above an hundred Pieces , and the Mainmast rent quire down to the Heel .
ro965	smell		perfumed|aromatic	the air			I		upon|after crossing the river Rapty		I have been led to these reflexions by an account , sent me some time ago by my brother in India , of the Spikenard , or Nardus Indica , a name familiar in the works of the ancient physicians , naturalists , and poets ; but the identity of which has not hitherto been satisfactorily ascertained .	He says , in a letter dated Lucknow , December 1786 , that , ` ` travelling with the Nabob Vizier , upon one of his hunting excursions towards the northern mountains , I was surprised one day , after crossing the river Rapty , about twenty miles from the foot of the hills , to perceive the air perfumed with an aromatic smell ; and , upon asking the cause , I was told it proceeded from the roots of the grass that were bruised or trodden out of the ground by the feet of the elephants and horses of the Nabob ' s retinue .	The country was wild and uncultivated , and this was the common grass which covered the surface of it , growing in large tufts close to each other , very rank , and in general from three to four feet in length .

The whole plant has a strong aromatic odour ; but both the smell and the virtues reside principally in the husky roots , which in chewing have a bitter , warm , pungent taste , accompanied with some degree of that kind of glow in the mouth which cardamoms occasion .

There is great reason , however , to think , that it is the true Nardus Indica of the ancients ; for , first , the circumstance , in the account above recited , of its being discovered in an unfrequented country from the odour it exhaled by being trod upon by the elephants and horses , corresponds , in a striking manner , with an occurrence related by ARRIAN , in his History of the Expedition of Alexander the Great into India .	It is there mentioned , lib .
ro965	fragrant|fragrant|perfume	spica|plants|the lavender	fragrant|fragrant|grateful								Secondly , though the accounts of the ancients concerning this plant are obscure and defective , it is evident , it was a plant of the order of gramina ; for the term arista , so often applied to it , was appropriated by them to the fructification of grains and grasses , and seems to be a word of Greek original to denote the most excellent portion of these plants , which are the most useful in the vegetable creation for the sustenance of animal life , and nature has also kindly made them the most abundant in all parts of the habitable earth .	The term spica is applied to plants of the natural order verticillatae , in which there are many species of fragrant plants , and the lavender , which being an indigenous one , affording a grateful perfume , was called Nardus Italica by the Romans ; but we never find the term arista applied to these .	The poets , as well as the naturalists , constantly apply this latter term to the true Nardus .
ro965	perfume|aromatic		grateful								But as Italy is very remote from the native country of this plant , it is reasonable to suppose , that others , more easily procurable , used to be substituted for it ; and the same author says , that there were nine different plants by which it could be imitated and adulterated .	There would be strong temptations to do this from the great demand for it , and the expense and difficulty of distant inland carriage ; and as it was much used as a perfume , being brought into Greece and Italy in the form of an unguent manufactured in Laodicea , Tarsus , and other towns of Syria and Asia Minor , it is probable , that any grateful aromatic resembling it was allowed to pass for it .	It is probable , that the Nardus of PLINY , and great part of what is now imported from the Levant , and found under that name in the shops , is a plant growing in the countries on the Euphrates , or in Syria , where the great emporiums of the eastern and western commerce were situated .

The favourite perfume which was used at the ancient baths and feasts was the unguentum nardinum ; and it appears , from a passage in HORACE , that it was so valuable , that as much of it as could be contained in a small box of precious stone was considered as a sort of equivalent for a large vessel of wine , and a handsome quota for a guest to contribute at an entertainment , according to the custom of antiquity : Nardo vinum merebere Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum .	It may here be remarked , that as its sensible qualities do not depend on a principle so volatile as essential oil , like most other aromatic vegetables , this would be a great recommendation to the ancients , as its virtues would thereby be more durable , and they were not acquainted with the method of collecting essential oils , being ignorant of the art of distillation .

The author adduces further evidence in support of the opinions he advanced in his former communication relative to the identity of the odoriferous principles which are disengaged during electric discharges in common air , during the electrolysis of water , and during the slow action of phosphorus upon atmospheric air .	This principle , termed Ozone , he regards as being a simple body , and a constituent of azote , which he believes to be a compound of hydrogen and ozone ; and he explains the disengagement of this latter element , which he considers as analogous in its chemical character to chlorine , by the partial decomposition of azote , in consequence of its hydrogen combining with oxygen , in the several processes above - mentioned during which ozone makes its appearance .

This body of fire changed its direction , and fell on my house , forced a brick out of the chimney , near that part of it to which the iron bar was fastened , and went through the house to an outward door on the opposite side , which happened to be open ; there it burst with a loud noise , like the firing of cannons , and filled the room where I was with smoke and the smell of sulphur .

It will , therefore , be proper to apply stimulating medicines , such as the vapour of volatile alkali , mixed with the air ; which may easily be done , by holding spirits of hartshorn in a cup under the receiver of the bellows .	I would advise the air and volatile alkali to be thrown in by the nose , if by both nostrils so much the better , as we know , that applications of this kind to the olfactory nerves rouse the living principle , and put the muscles of respiration into action , while some applications to the mouth rather depress than rouse , by producing sickness .

As I always suspected , from the taste and smell that vegetable acids differed materially from one another , and was the more confirmed in this opinion by the above experiment mentioned by Dr .

To all which I must add what he notes concerning the Intestin called Caecum , the Use of which is so much controverted amongst Anatomists , but discovered by this Author to be , that as the Bladder of Gall is the receptacle of the Gall , so this Caecum is the receiver of the Flatus or winds ; and that thence it is , that commonly it is found empty or only some clear water in it , which the winds have been turned into : Adding , that Nature hath made this Intestin larger in Hoggs , Birds of prey , and other Beasts , which by reason of their voracity are more subject to crudities , and therefore to winds , & amp ; c .

I heated the olive coloured substance with potassium , there was a combination , but without any luminous appearance , and a gray metallic mass was formed ; but from the effect of this upon water , I could not affirm that any oxygene had been added to the metal , the gas given off had a peculiar smell , and took up more oxygene by detonation than pure hydrogene , from which it seems probable , that it held some of the conbustible matter in solution .	It occurred to me , that if the pure inflammable basis were capable of being deoxygenated by potassium , it would probably possess a stronger affinity for oxygene , than hydrogene , and therefore be again brought to its former state by water .

When a portion of it was thrown into water , it effrvesced violently , and the gas evolved had some resemblance in smell to phosphuretted hydrogene , and was inflammable .	When a part of the mass was heated in contact with air , it burnt slowly , lost its brown colour , and became a white salilne mass .

ro1159	odour	by the bodies of black people	stronger								From the result of the experiments detailed , it is evident , that if a black surface absorbs caloric in greatest quantity , it also gives it out in the same proportion ; and thus a circulation of heat is as it were established , calculated to promote the insensible perspiration , and to keep the body cool .	This view is confirmed by the observed fact of the stronger odour exhaled by the bodies of black people .	The different shades of colour by which races of men inhabiting different climates are distinguished , equally possess , there is reason to believe , the quality of modifying the individual temperature , and keeping it at the proper mean .

My attention was first directed to the subject of odours , as connected with colour , during my attendance at the anatomical rooms in the winter session 1830 - 1831 .	During the earlier part of that winter I generally wore a light olive - coloured dress ; but happening one day to attend the rooms in black clothes , I was not a little struck by the almost intolerable smell they had acquired .

To try the effect of odours upon a vegetable substance , I took equal quantities of black and white cotton wool , and enclosed them with assafoetida .	Two similar quantities were at the same time exposed to the emanations of cainphor in another drawer .

In both the black - coloured cotton had attracted the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as palpably evidenced by the smell .	These experiments were made in the month of April 1831 ; but it was not till August following that I had an opportunity of extending the investigation to other colours .

The black in both experiments had attracted by far the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as evidenced to smell ; the red next followed in point of intensity of smell ; and the white , so far as could be judged , had attracted least of the odour .	5 .
ro1159	odour			by coloured substances			myself|many of my friends				The same experiments were tried on cotton of similar colours , and with the same results .	Circumstances prevented me from resuming these investigations till the summer of 1832 , when I repeated the experiments with a greater variety of coloured substances , in wool , cotton , and silk , and satisfied not only myself but many of my friends , that odour was attracted nearly in the same ratio as caloric , by coloured substances .	The experiments were conducted in the same manner as the preceding .

ro1159	odours			vegetable and animal substances							10 .	I next endeavoured to ascertain the comparative power of vegetable and animal substances , so far as regards their influence over odours .	This was a much more delicate point to ascertain with sufficient accuracy , and free from fallacy , as it was difficult to obtain wool of the same degree of fineness as cotton , the substances I generally preferred for these experiments .

Indeed , from many experiments I have made to ascertain this fact , wool appears to have a peculiar attraction for fetid odours .	For instance , if , after having allowed wool to lie in contact with camphor for some time , it be afterwards placed , even for a very few hours , near a minute portion of sulphuret of barium ( which , it is wMell known , exhales copiously the fetid odour of sulphuretted hydrogen , ) it quickly loses the camphorous smell , and acquires and even retains in considerable intensity the fetid smell of the sulphuret .

I was therefore desirous , that , if possible , at least one experiment should be devised , which would show , by the evidence of actual increase of weight , that one colour invariably attracted more of any odorous substance than another ; and upon considering the various odorous substances which could be easily volatilized without change , and whose odour was inseparable from the substance , I fixed upon camphor as the one best suited to my purpose .

In an experiment of this nature , it was necessary that the camphor should be volatilized or converted into vapour , and that the coloured substances should be so placed as to come in contact with the camphor while in that state .
ro1159	odours|smell			the coloured substances|colours							Proceeding on this plan , I arrived at the most satisfactory and conclusive results .	The deposition of the camphor in various proportions on the coloured substances submitted to experiment , offered evidence of the particular attraction of colours for odours , resting on ocular demonstration ; and when to this is added the evidence arising from a positive increase of weight , as ascertained by the balance , the conclusions previously drawn from the sense of smell are confirmed in a singular and very satisfactory manner .	I have in this mode repeated all the former experiments with differently coloured substances ; but shall here only detail a few , as sufficient to show the general results .

ro1159	odorous|odorous	particles	odorous|odorous	smooth surfaces of							I now varied the experiment by employing square pieces of card of equal size , coloured with different preparations of lead .	This was done with the view of ascertaining whether smooth surfaces of equal density , and coloured as nearly as possible with matter of the same nature , would absorb odorous particles with the same facility as loose portions of wool .	The colours were mixed up with a solution of gum arabic , and laid on the cards as equally as possible with a camel - hair pencil .
ro1159	odours	silk									The black wool gained 1 - igrain , and the black silk 1 17Y grain .	From this experiment it would appear that of these two animal substances , silk possesses the greatest attraction for odours .	2 .
ro1159	odours			different substances							.	The last experiments tend to show that different substances attract odours in different proportions , and this independent of the texture or fineness of the substance employed .	Wool , though generally coarser in the filament than cotton , has yet a greater attraction for odours ; and silk more than wool .

The influence of coloured surfaces upon the absorption and emission of odours , having , I trust , been satisfactorily shown , it only remains for me to state shortly some of the practical conclusions which may be drawn from the experiments detailed .

He therefore disregards lime - washing , except as a general mode of cleaning walls , and attributes no other beneficial effect to it than as contributing to cleanliness .

ro1169	smell|arsenic|arsenic	of arseniuretted hydrogen|arsenic|arsenic									The combination was found to conduct very well , and oxygen and hydrogen were given off at their respective electrodes .	The solution in the platinode cell assumed a grayish appearance , but there was no smell of arseniuretted hydrogen , nor was any arsenic deposited upon the electrode .	The solution had become neutral to test paper .
ro1169	smell	of arseniuretted hydrogen									) A solution of arsenite of potassa ( KO , As2 03 ) was carefully prepared ( by dissolving single equivalents of arsenious acid and bicarbonate of potassa in boiling water ) , and placed in the platinode cell of the diaphragm apparatus ; the connecting cell and the zincode cell were both charged with solution of potassa .	During the electrolysis oxygen was given off at the zincode , but an equivalent of hydrogen was not obtained at the platinode , the electrode being covered with metallic arsenic , which was deposited in such abundance as speedily to render the liquid opake ; there was no smell of arseniuretted hydrogen .	This diffusion of the metal reduced by secondary action , throughout the solution , contrasts well with the compact manner in which metals are deposited , which , like copper from the neutral sulphate , .
ro1169	odour	of sulphurous acid	strong			at the latter					Hydrogen was given off abundantly at the platinode , but no gas was evolved at the zincode .	There was a strong odour of sulphurous acid at the latter , with a gradual deposition of sulphur .	This doubtless arose from the secondary action of the sulphuric acid , which was first formed upon the salt with which it was in contact , by which hyposulphurous acid was disengaged , and immediately decomposed .

The liquid at the zincode was of a very dark brown - green colour , and strongly acid , it had a pungent peculiar smell , the liquid soon became perfectly opake , and one cubic inch of oxygen was collected from the zincode .	Though the colour of the two solutions in the electrode cells had undergone such marked changes , the colour of that in the intermediate cell remained unaltered .

The solution smelled strongly of hydrocyanic acid , of which , by the proper tests , it was found to contain a considerable quantity .	There can be no doubt that the brown matter which was abundantly formed was paracyanogen , which is soluble in the alkaline solution of the cyanide of potassium , and which must have been produced either by the spontaneous decomposition of the hydrocyanic acid , or in a way something analogous to the formation of the red ferrocyanide of potassium from the yellow by the absorption of an additional quantity of ferroQyanogen .

There was a copious orangecoloured deposit in the zincode cell and upon the plate which interrupted the progress of the electrolysis ; no particular odour was perceptible in either of the cells .	The liquid filtered from the zincode became turbid by exposure to the air , and deposited more of the yellow compound .

The Tumour itself was Cartilaginous for the Space of half an Inch from its external Surface ; from whence it formed numberless bony Substances of various Forms , Colours , and Consistences , which ( growing more and more numerous , as they lay deeper ) at last formed a continual Substance comH pletely pletely ossify ' d : In the Centre of this bony Substance we found about a Quart of mucilaginous Liquor , no ways fetid , ( though it was then ten Days from the Operation ) whose Colour and Consistence nearly resembled that of Linseed Oil ; in which we observed many little bony Substances loose and floating , similar to many others adhering to the internal Surface of the Cavity , all which had nearly the Appearance of those irregular Incrustations , which in hollow Rocks are sometimes made by the dropping of petrifying Waters .

To a moiety of this extract of a syrupy consistence , a drop of nitric acid was added ; the effect produced was just the same as if human urine had been the subject of the experiment ; a crystalline compound was immediately formed , which I could not hesitate in pronouncing nitrate of urea .

ro1249	Smell		violent strong Sulphureous			in her Chamber	she				Communicated by Samuel Molyneux Esq ; Secretary of the Philosophical Society at Dublin .	WHEN I went to wait upon this Gentlewoman , about a Fortnight after , to inform my self in all the Particulars of this Extraordinary Accident , she then told me , That the whole Day was Close , Hot and Sultry , little or no Wind stirring until towards the Evening ; That there was a small Breeze with some mizling Rain , which lasted about an Hour ; That as the Air darkned after Sun set , she saw several faint Flashes of Lightning , and heard some Thunder Claps as at a distance ; That between ten and eleven a Clock both were very violent and terrible , and so increased and came on more frequent until a little before twelve a Clock ; That one Flash of Lightning and Clap of Thunder came both at the same time louder and more dreadful than all the rest , which , as she thought , shook and inflamed the whole House ; and being sensible at that Instant of a violent strong Sulphureous Smell in her Chamber , which she did not perceive before now , and feeling a thick gross Dust falling on her Hands and Face as she lay in Bed , she concluded no less than that part of her House was thrown down by the Thunder , or set on Fire by the Lightning ; That arising in this Fright , she called up her Family , and Candles being lighted , she found her Bed - chamber full of Smoke and Dust , as also the Kitchen that was beneath it : The rest of the House being safe , she was not sollicitous at that time about any other damage she might have sustained , more than that she observed the Looking glass , that hung in her Chamber , to be broken .	The next day again she found upon further search and inquiry , that part of the Top or Cornish of the Chimney , which stood without that Gabel - end of the House where her Chamber was , was struck off ; That part of the Copeing of the Splay of the Gabel end it self was broken down , and the Shingles on the Roof adjoining thereto ( to the number of 12 or 16 ) were raised or ruffled , but none shattered or carried away ; That part of the Ceiling in her Chamber beneath those Shingles was forced down , and part of the Plaister and Pinning Stones of the adjoining Wall , was also broken off and loosened , ( the whole Breach 16 or 20 Inches broad .

The Gentlewoman told me , there was a yellow Singe or Stain perceivable on some part of the other Linen so damaged the next day ; and that the whole Linen smelt strong of Sulphur ; but neither this yellow Stain or Smell was perceivable when I was there : That the Glass of two Windows in the Bed - Chamber above , and two Windows in the Kitchen beneath , was so shattered , that there was scarce one whole Pane left in any of them ; That the Pewter , Brass , and Iron Furniture in the Kitchen were thrown down , and scattered about the Kitchen , particularly a large Girdle about 20 Pounds weight , that hung upon an Iron Hook near the Ceiling , was found lying on the Floor ; That a Cat was found Dead the next Morning in the Kitchen , with its Legs extended as in a going posture , in the middle of the Floor , with no other Sign of being hurt , than that the Furr was singed a little about the setting on of the Tail .	The Gentlewoman told me too , That about some few Days before this Accident happened to her , she removed a Table Press - Bed from the Place where the Hair Trunk stood , wherein two little Girls ( her Daughters ) used to lie ; which she looked upon as a particular Piece of Providence .

ro1276	odour|vapour	of some volatile body	most penetrating|peculiar								A thick oily liquid remained in the retort , and appeared to consist of boracic acid united with a smaller proportion of oxide of ethyl .	On adding zincethyl to the boracic ether thus prepared , a considerable elevation of temperature gradually occurred , whilst at the same time a most penetrating and peculiar odour was developed , due apparently to the vapour of some volatile body , that not unfrequently burst into flame , when the cork was removed from the flask in which the reaction took place .	Some preliminary experiments showed that this volatile body could be distilled unchanged from the mixture , and that it was neither miscible with , nor apparently decomposed by , water .

Ammonia - boric ethide is a somewhat oily liquid , possessing an aromatic odour and an alkaline reaction .

A slow evolution of a spontaneously inflammable gas , burning with a splendid green flame , was also noticed ; and this evolution of gas became more rapid when the warmth of the hand was applied to the flask containing the ingredients .
ro1276	odour	Boric methide	peculiar|intolerably pungent						at	irritating the mucous membrane , and provoking a copious flow of tears	The formation of boric methide under these circumstances proves conclusively that the corresponding ethyl compound is formed , not by the removal of the whole of the oxygen from boracic ether , but by the actual substitution of the three atoms of oxygen in boracic acid by three atoms of ethyl , whilst boric methide is in like manner produced by the similar substitution of methyl for oxygen , - a kind of substitution which is quite in harmony with the mode of formation of very numerous compounds in the organo - metallic family .	Boric methide exists at ordinary temperatures as a colourless and transparent gas , possessing a peculiar and intolerably pungent odour , irritating the mucous membrane , and provoking a copious flow of tears .	Its specific gravity is 1 - 93137 .

These peculiar shapes might , probably , be introduced originally with a view to conceal and disguise the real substance of isinglass , and preserve the monopoly ; but , as the mask is now taken off , it cannot be doubted to answer every purpose more effectually in its * native state , without any subsequent manufacture whatever , especially to the principal consumers , who hence will be enabled to procure sufficient supply from the British colonies .

The darkness continued to prevail during the 22nd , and the depth of the ashes was from four to five inches ; a fetid suolphurous smell proceeded from this deposit , which the slightest breath of air drove into every interstice .	At midnight violent explosions were heard , and , a quarter of an hour after , a severe shock was experienced , the forerunner of new eruptions .

The protuberances from which the olfactory nerves arise were probably large in the same proportion with the tubercula ; at least , in the brain of a shark , preserved in the Hunterian Collection , of a smaller size than that of the Squalus Maximus , but much larger than that of the Squalus Acanthias , that is the case .

The ordinary Boghead naphtha appears in commerce in the form of a nearly colourless fluid of a very characteristic odour , quite different to that obtained from ordinary coal .	Its specific gravity is only 0 ' 750 at 15 ? , and is therefore greatly lower than that from the latter source , for even thoroughly purified benzole has a density of 0 - 850 .

If pieces of sodium be rapidly cut from a mass , so as to have only a very thin layer of soda , and are then thrown into the perfectly dry hydrocarbon , the coating of oxide is dissolved , the metal appearing of the lustre of silver , and may probably be thus kept for any length of time .

The mixture was placed in an iron alembic , and the alcohol distilled off on the water - bath ; the latter was then removed , and the distillation continued over the naked fire .

The fluid in this condition left a yellow residue on distillation .

ro1468	smell	of ammonia	perceptible								It is known how readily formic acid and ammonia are produced at the expense of cyanogen , when water is present * , and it would appear that the action of heat upon this new double salt in water very frequently gives rise to these products .	In treating with boiling water the mixture of oxide of mercury and this salt , ( which is produced on digesting prussic acid with the latter in excess , ) in order to obtain the salt in solution , copious bubbles of gas are evolved , the smell of ammonia becomes perceptible , and mu - ch metallic mercury is precipitated * .	On concentrating the solutions also , decomposition takes place , with deposition of metallic mercury ; and when the crystallized salt is dissolved in boiling water , a black sediment in greater or less quantity is generally observable .

In preparing this salt , it is difficult so perfectly to neutralize the acetic acid , that , during the evaporation * , any excess that maybe present should not , as it becomes concentrated , decompose some of the bicyanide which the solution contains .

Even when in a perfectly dry state this compound can only be kept for a short time without undergoing decomposition ( which is accompanied by the production of a peculiar aromatic odour ) , the decomposition being complete in a few days .	It is formed according to the equation C12R 1 N3 + 6Br - - G6H4 N2 , HBr + C6H4Br3N + 2HBr .

By introducing a very concentrated solution of nitrate of diazobenzol into an excess of an equally concentrated solution of caustic potash , drop by drop , a yellowish liquid is obtained possessing a peculiar aromatic odour , and solidifying , by evaporation in the water - bath , to a crystalline mass .	This is a mixture of the compound of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol and nitre , together with a brownish - red amorphous bodythe result of a secondary reaction , which a portion of the original substance undergoes , and which is always indicated by the evolution of gas .

All the compounds hitherto described exist in a solid state , and none of them can be volatilized without decomposition ; the new compounds to be described , on the other hand , are liquors which can be distilled , and which possess the narcotic odour of some vegetable bases , such as conidine and nicotine .	Beyond this odour , however , they have nothing in common with these natural bases .

When the reaction is complete , the liquid is submitted to distillation , when a very nauseous , heavy , yellowish oil is found to pass over with the aqueous vapour .	I have not pursued its examination further than to convince myself that it is not the phenylmercaptan ( 06H6S ) described by VOGT , which at first sight it appeared to be .

Its mercaptanic odour and its derivation from the diazobenzol in the gold - compound ( according to the equation C6 H4 N2 + SH2 = 6116 S + N2 ) rendered this view very probable .	Neither basic acetate of lead , however , nor nitrate of silver , even in the presence of ammonia , gave precipitates with the oil , which proved convincingly that it differed entirely from phenylmercaptan .

It is obtained perfectly pure by distilling once with chloride of calcium , and forms an almost colourless oil , which is heavier than water and has the odour of benzol .

Left exposed to the open air it appears gradually to volatilize , giving off the same aromatic ammoniacal odour which characterizes diazobenzolimide .	It resembles the latter , moreover , in its behaviour with various reagents ; caustic potassa , hydrochloric acid , and bromine have no action upon it , strong sulphuric and nitric acids decompose it readily .

' On heating an aqueous solution of nitrate or hydrobromate of diazobromobenzol 5A2 701 an evolution of nitrogen gas takes place , bromophenylic acid ( which separates as a brownish oil of the odour of creosote ) being simultaneously produced .

It possesses many peculiar and distinct properties ; among which the most obvious are , a disagreeable characteristic smell emitted by no other known substance ; inflammability , when mixed with a certain proportion of respirable or nitrous air ; miscibility with water , to a certain degree ; and a power of discolouring metals , particularly silver and mercury .

ro1517	smell	a strong solution of liver of sulphur	hepatic						even in the temperature		Liver of sulphur exercises a strong solving power on the earth of crucibles , and readily pierces through them .	The above experiment seems to show that liver of sulphur will not yield hepatic air without the addition of an acid ; and I believe this to be true when the experiment is made in the dry way , and nearly so in the moist way ; for having added 200 grains of sulphur to a concentrated solution of strong caustic vegetable alkali , by a strong and long - continued heat I obtained only 1 cubic inch of hepatic air ; yet it is well known , that a strong solution of liver of sulphur constantly emits an hepatic smell , even in the temperature of the atmosphere ; and the substance so emitted contains so much hepatic air as to discolour silver and lead , and even their solutions ; which shows , that an incomparably small quantity of this air is capable of producing this effect .	To discover whether this extrication of hepatic air might be caused by the deposition of fixed air from the atmosphere , I threw some pulverised calcareous hepar into aerated water , and by the application of heat endeavoured to obtain hepatic air , but in vain : and , indeed , the very circumstance that the hepatic smell , and its effects , are always strongest the first instant that a bottle of the hepatic solution is opened , seems to indicate that fixed air is no way concerned in its production .
ro1517	smell		strongest						a bottle of the hepatic solution is opened		The above experiment seems to show that liver of sulphur will not yield hepatic air without the addition of an acid ; and I believe this to be true when the experiment is made in the dry way , and nearly so in the moist way ; for having added 200 grains of sulphur to a concentrated solution of strong caustic vegetable alkali , by a strong and long - continued heat I obtained only 1 cubic inch of hepatic air ; yet it is well known , that a strong solution of liver of sulphur constantly emits an hepatic smell , even in the temperature of the atmosphere ; and the substance so emitted contains so much hepatic air as to discolour silver and lead , and even their solutions ; which shows , that an incomparably small quantity of this air is capable of producing this effect .	To discover whether this extrication of hepatic air might be caused by the deposition of fixed air from the atmosphere , I threw some pulverised calcareous hepar into aerated water , and by the application of heat endeavoured to obtain hepatic air , but in vain : and , indeed , the very circumstance that the hepatic smell , and its effects , are always strongest the first instant that a bottle of the hepatic solution is opened , seems to indicate that fixed air is no way concerned in its production .	The best liver of sulphur is made of equal parts of salt of tartar and sulphur ; but as about one - fifth of the salt of tartar consists of air which escapes during the operation , it seems , that the proportion of sulphur predominates in the resulting compound ; yet as some of the sulphur also sublimes and burns , it is not easy to fix the exact proportion .
ro1517	smell	its	peculiar		that of vinegar				in the temperature of the atmosphere|mixed		The concentrated vitriolic acid , poured on liver of sulphur , affords but little hepatic air without the assistance of heat , though it instantly decomposes the liver of sulphur ; and it is partly for this reason that the proportion of air is so small ; for it is during the gradual decomposition of sulphureous compounds that hepatic air is produced .	Distilled vinegar extricates this air in the temperature of the atmosphere ; but it is not pure , its peculiar smell being mixed with that of vinegar .	The acid of sugar also produced some quantity of this air in the temperature of 59 ~ .
ro1517	smell			This air	resembling that of onions						A mixture of two parts white sugar ( previously melted in order to free it from water ) with one part sulphur , when heated to about 600 or 700 degrees , gave out hepatic air very rapidly .	This air had a smell much resembling that of onions ; it contained no fixed air , nor saccharine , or other acid .	But sugar and sulphur , melted together , gave out no hepatic air when treated with acids .

It is true , the heat I applied might be insufficient ; for the inflammable air passing over with a slight heat , the mercury ascended so high into the neck of the receiver , that , fearing the rupture of the retort , I was obliged to interrupt the operation .

The liver of sulphur was somewhat whitened on the surface ; the air had not an hepatic smell , but rather that of bread .	It was not converted into phlogisticated air , but seemed to have taken up some sulphur , which lime - water separated .
ro1517	smell	this	hepatic						On adding one cubic inch of water to this air		It was not diminished in four days ; nor was the sulphur sensibly .	On adding one cubic inch of water to this air , it was absorbed all to one inch , and this had an hepatic smell ; so that neither was the sulphur decomposed , nor the marine acid converted into inflammable air .	The water had also an hepatic smell , and evidently contained sulphur ; for it precipitated the solution of silver brown mixed with white , and the nitrous solution of copper reddish brown , and when vegetable fixed alkali was dropped into it , let fall a white precipitate , namely , the sulphur .
ro1517	smell	sulphur|the nitrous solution	hepatic	The water							On adding one cubic inch of water to this air , it was absorbed all to one inch , and this had an hepatic smell ; so that neither was the sulphur decomposed , nor the marine acid converted into inflammable air .	The water had also an hepatic smell , and evidently contained sulphur ; for it precipitated the solution of silver brown mixed with white , and the nitrous solution of copper reddish brown , and when vegetable fixed alkali was dropped into it , let fall a white precipitate , namely , the sulphur .	SECTION II .
ro1517	smell	sulphur|of vitriolic air							During the combustion		I found a mixture of one part of hepatic air and 1 , 5 of common air to burn blue , without flashing or detonating .	During the combustion sulphur is constantly deposited , and a smell of vitriolic air is perceived .	A mixture of half hepatic and half nitrous air burns with a bluish , green , and yellow lambent flame ; sulphur is also deposited , and in proportion as this is formed , a candle dipped in this air burns more weakly , and is at last extinguished .
ro1517	smell		hepatic						Four		The same quantity of hepatic and fixed air remained four days without any sensible diminution .	Four measures of water absorbed the greater part of both , had an hepatic smell , precipitated lime from its solution , and also silver , as usual .	The residuum extinguished a candle .
ro1517	smell	It	vitriolic								Another part of it extinguished a candle .	It had not a vitriolic smell .	The water which had taken up four - tenths of its bulk of this air did not precipitate lime ; nor did it affect acetous baroselenite in less than a quarter of an hour , and then produced a very slight cloud .

The residuary air had still an hepatic smell , and was somewhat further diminished by water ; and in the unabsorbed part a candle burned naturally .	The water had all the properties of hepatic water .
ro1517	smell|smell	It|of alkaline air				from the jar			after the air itself was poured into another jar		It exhibited the following appearances .	1 ~ , It had the smell of alkaline air pretty strongly ; at least that smell issued from the jar that contained it after the air itself was poured into another jar .	2 ~ , A candle burned in it naturally .
ro1517	smell		sharp alkaline	The jar							The flame was exceeding white and vivid ; but it did not detonate in the least , but rather resembled dephlogisticated air .	The jar out of which it had been transferred had a sharp alkaline smell .	This air was not in the least diminished by nitrous air , even when heated to 150 degrees ; which heat I contrived to produce by passing the upper part of the jar that contained this air into another wider jar , furnished with a perforated cork bottom , and filling this with water heated to that degree .
ro1517	smell		exceeding sharp urinous						as soon as the jar		In this experiment great care was taken to have each of the mixed airs as pure as possible , and the alkaline was admitted all at once , instead of by different portions , merely with that view ; and it is probable , that , if the due proportion were hit upon , nothing would remain .	The scum appears to be almost liquid , and as soon as the jar is emptied of mercury , it breaks out into a white smoke , with an exceeding sharp urinous smell .	Five measures of martial hepatic air were , upon the admission of 51 / 4 of alkaline air , reduced to something more than one measure , and upon the addition of water there remained but half a measure ; and this was inflammable , with detonation ; the inflammable air undoubtedly proceeding from the solution of the iron .
ro1517	smell		vitriolic								I then added another measure of alkaline air : in three hours after there remained but 1 , 25 cubic inches .	In passing this residuum through water it was reduced to about half a cubic inch ; and this burned with a blue lambent flame , without leaving a vitriolic smell or any deposit on the glass ; so that it clearly was inflammable air from the sugar .	I once imagined I had obtained inflammable air from a mixture of alkaline air with hepatic air drawn from liver of sulphur ; but I afterwards found this inflammable air proceeded from a very slight contamination of zinc in the mercury over which my airs had been produced ; the alkaline air acted on this zinc , and must have produced the inflammable air ; for when I afterwards received and mixed these airs over mercury , perfectly purified , I obtained no more inflammable air .
ro1517	smell		hepatic	The							I then stopped the tube with a ground glass stopper , and laid it by for twelve hours ; after which interval I found the liquor in the tube white and turbid , and but weakly acid , much water having entered in spite of my endeavours to exclude it .	The remaining air slightly detonated on presenting to it a lighted candle , and had an hepatic smell .	But as this hepatic air was obtained from sulphureo - martial paste , it does not prove that inflammable air enters into the composition of other hepatic airs , derived from the union of sulphur with substances that do not yield inflammable air .
ro1517	smell|it	of the aether|of the hepatic air	very offensive		resembling that of putrefying animal substances				on adding water		When hepatic air is mixed with an equal bulk of vitriolic aether , the bulk of the air is at first increased ; but afterwards half of it is absorbed , and a slight precipitation appears .	The smell of the aether is mixed with that of the hepatic air ; but on adding water it becomes very offensive , resembling that of putrefying animal substances .	To one measure of hepatic air I added 1 , 5 of the nitrous solution of silver the air was immediately , without agitation , reduced to half a measure , and the solution blackened , The remaining air admitted a candle to burn naturally .
ro1517	smell	Bubbles of phosphoric air		into the atmosphere	like the electric spark						To a measure of this air I let up a measure of water , and through this some small bubbles of common air ; every bubble flamed and produced a white smoke until about half as much common air was introduced as there was originally of phosphoric ; and yet the original bulk did not appear increased ; the flame each time produced a small commotion , and a smoke descended after inflammation into the water : when flame ceased to be produced , smoke still followed the introduction of more common air .	Bubbles of phosphoric air , escaping through mercury into the atmosphere , flame , crackle , and smell , exactly like the electric spark * .	To a measure of phosphoric air I let up a half measure of nitrous air : a white smoke appeared , with an exceeding slight diminution , and the transparency was soon restored , a slight scum being deposited on the sides of the jar .
ro1517	smell		phosphoric	The water							Upon turning up the jar the nitrous air first escaped in the form of a red vapour , and this was followed by a whitish smoke .	The water had a phosphoric smell , and precipitated the solution of silver brown .	In this experiment the acid of the nitrous air seems to have acted the same part that it does in hepatic air .

And , though I kept within doors , yet I sensibly discovered a stinking sulphureous smell in the Air .

Those immediately made up to the others , and ( some leaping into the Water to them ) presently drew them either into the Boat or on Shore ; yet none of them saw these two fall into the Water ( not looking that way ) but heard one of them cry out for help presently upon the stroke , and smelt a very strange stinking smell in the Air ; which , when I asked him , that told it me , what kind of stink ? he said , like such a smell , as is perceived upon the stricking of Flints together .

The same gentlemen told me , that this inflammable air had in some respects the advantage over the inflammable airs extracted from metals by the vitriolic or marine acid , and that extracted from mud or marhses ; because this air being heavier than either of these airs , and even than common air , is not so easily lost out of an open vessel ; and , that when it escapes into the open air , it agreeably perfumes the room with the smell of spiritus vitrioli dulcis or aether ; whereas the other inflammable airs , which from their less specific gravity escape easily into the common air , yield an offensive , disagreeable stench .

The solution was extremely bittern and acted but slightly on dissolved isinglass , with which , however , it formed some flocculi ; with sulphate of iron it produced a brown precipitate ; with muriate of tin one which was blackish brown ; nitrate of lime had not any effect ; but acetite of - lead occasioned a very copious precipitate of a pale brown colour .

The digestion was continued until a deep yellow dry mass remained , and the mattress being still kept in the sand - bath , a brilliant feather - like sublimate arose , which weighed rather more than six grains , and had the aspect , odour , and properties of benzoic acid .	* The residuum was of a brown colour , and with water formed a golden yellow - coloured solution , which by nitrate of lime was not affected .

At this period , scarcely any stjlphureous acid was evolved , but in about one hour the liquid became blackish - brown ; much sulphureous acid gas was then produced , and continued to increase during four hours , when the whole appeared like a thick black liquid , at which period not any odour or , appearance of camphor could be perceived , but only that of the sulphureous acid .	After two days , during which time the alembic had not been heated , there did not appeear any alteration , unless that the production of sulphur - reous gas was much diminished .

ro1568	odour	the vegetable essential oil|of it									When the whole of the water was come over , there was again a slight production of sulphureous gas .	I then added two ounces of water , which I drew off by distillation , but did not obtain any of the vegetable essential oil which has been mentioned , nor did the odour of it return , I therefore continued the distillation until a dry blackish brown mass remained this was well washed with warm distilled water , by which , however , nothing was extracted ; but when two ounces of alcohol were digested on it during twenty - four hours , a very dark brown tincture was formed .	The residuum was digested with two other ounces of alcohol in like manner , and the process was repeated until the alcohol ceased to act .

The different portions of the solution formed by alcohol were added together , and being distilled by means of a waterbath , a blackish brown substance was obtained , which had the appearance of a resin or gum with a slight odour of caromel , and weighed 49 grains .

The gas , when thus obtained , is of a pale reddish yellow colour ; has an odour somewhat resembling that of chlorine , though less pungent .

The flies of every plant have continual access to those plants , and no doubt are prompted by the sight , smell , or other qualities of their native vegetable , which are congenial to them , to propagate their kind upon them .

A number of dry aromatic plantst were obtained from Covent Garden , the leaves and flowers of which were stuffed into glass tubes 18 inches long and a quarter of an inch in diameter .	By means of my second air - pump , a current of dry air was first passed over them for some minutes .

Still we find that the least energetic in the list has thirty times the effect of the air , while the most energetic produces 109 times the same effect .

After the zero had been attained in the case of a strong perfume , a few minutes ' rest of the pump sufficed to bring the scent from its hiding - places in the crevices and cocks of the apparatus , and almost to restore the original deflection .	The quantity of those residues must be left to the imagination to conceive .

ro1636	scent		weak|strong								It is a certain fact ; that , in the several senses , the proper objects being suppose present , the sensation is entirely relative ; or , in other words , that the presence of a powerful object always obliterates the present sensation of a weak object ; and that the constant habitual presence of any one object , in the same given degree , produces no sensation at all .	Thus we observe , that the light of the sun extinguishes the light of the stars ; a stronger taste covers a weaker ; the sound of a drum drowns an ordinary human voice ; itching is banished by smart and pain ; a weak scent , by one that is strong ; cold , or a less degree of warmth , by heat , or a greater degree of warmth ; and universally , our daily experience demonstrates to us , that every organ of sense , made familiar to a given degree of its object , affords no manner of sensation of the object in the given degree .	Thus it fares with the warm blood , which has constantly flowed through the whole minute substance of every muscle of voluntary motion in an animal body , from the time of their formation , or unfolding in the womb .

As the foul Air is drawn away from the sick Rooms , the Air in the neighbouring Apartments will gradually come into the Room through the smallest Passages : But there is a Contrivance to apply the Pipes which go to the sick Room to the Blowing - Pipe B , while the Sucking - Pipe receives its Air only from the Room where the Machine stands .

When exposed to the action of the blow - pipe , they blacken and emit a strong odour of burning animal matter , very different from that of pure uric acid .	This arises from a variable proportion of animal matter which they contain , and which occasions the loss in the analysis of these calculi .

It was found , by dropping into it a little acid of vitriol and committing it to evaporation , to contain a small quantity of volatile alcali ; as it left four grains of a brownish salt , which being re - dissolved in water , yielded a smell of volatile alcali on the addition of lime .	It is doubtless this volatile alcali , which is the cause of the precipitate , which the distilled water makes with sugar of lead and corrosive sublimate .
ro1694	smell	of volatile alcali									It is doubtless this volatile alcali , which is the cause of the precipitate , which the distilled water makes with sugar of lead and corrosive sublimate .	What first suggested to me that the distilled water contained a volatile alcali , was the distilling some of it over again in a retort ; whereby the first runnings were so much impregnated with volatile alcali , as to turn paper died with the juice of blue flowers , to a green colour , and in some measure to yield a smell of volatile alcali .	In the foregoing experiment , the salt procured from the distilled water was perfectly neutral ; so that the quantity of acid employed was certainly not more than sufficient to saturate the alcali , but it may very likely have been less ; as in that case the superfluous volatile alcali would have flown off in the evaporation .
ro1698	Smell	it									This may be known by the following Characteristicks ; viz .	it is usually concreted into large Grains or Chrystals , which are firm and hard , and in respect to those of other Kinds of common Salt , the most solid and ponderous ; it is not disposed to grow moist in a moderately dry Air , to which it has been exposed a considerable time ; its Colour is white , and somewhat diaphanous ; it hath no Smell ; its Taste is truly muriatic , and more sharp and pungent than that of other Kinds of common Salt .	It has , besides these , several other distinguishing Properties mentioned by our Author .
ro1700	smell	of chlorine							When a solution of this salt , in strong mulriatic acid , is heated		When the triple compound of iodine , oxygen , and potassium , is dissolved in nitric acid , the acid may be distilled without any decomposition of the salt ; but when it is dissolved in sulphuric acid orphosphoric acid , the heat which these acids will bear is sufficient to decompose the salt , which then yields oxygen and iodine , and leaves sulphate or phosphate of potash .	When a solution of this salt , in strong mulriatic acid , is heated , there is a smell of chlorine , the fluid becomes yellow , and yields , by distillation , chloriodic acid .	A solution of the triple compound , in sulphurous acid , when distilled , yields iodine , and leaves sulphate of potash ; but the phenomena are variously modified , by a greater or less proportion of either ingredient .

The Waters of the Spring du Pied have the same Quality as those of the Salut : They produce the same Effect when mixed with Galls ; yield Crystals exactly of the same Figure , but in yet greater Quantity .

On rubbing a solution of the oxide between the fingers , the well - known sensation produced by the fixed alkalies under the same circumstances is felt , and we perceive moreover the same peculiar odour .	Oxide of tetrethylammonium saponifies the fats as readily as potassa .

During this change a powerful ammoniacal odour is evolved , the substance strongly intumesces , and is by degrees perfectly volatilized .	If this process be conducted in an appropriate apparatus , it is found that the base , under these circumstances , yields three products of decomposition , namely , water , an highly alkaline oil , rather soluble in water , and a colourless inflammable gas .

Diethylamylamine - for this is the name which appertains to the new compound has a peculiar , not unpleasant aromatic odour , and an analogous somewhat bitter taste , is lighter than water , in which it scarcely dissolves , imparting to it a slight but decided alkaline reaction .	It combines with acids less readily than do the bases which occupy a lower position in the system .

Both these properties are much more marked than those of diethylamylamine , which it resembles in most respects .

From want of pure material , the boiling - point could not be determined with accuracy .

Here we find a very marked difference between the properties of the compound ammonia , and those of the ammonium - oxide belonging to it ; in the latter , we observe no longer any feature which could possibly betray the presence of the former ; all their habits , volatility , odour , taste , & amp ; c .	are totally changed ; there is a difference between the two groups which is not inferior to that between ammonia and potassa .

The next morning , upon removing my dressings , a fetid matter ensued ; whereupon , dilating the small sinus with my scissors , the scapula of a foetus presented itself .	On the 25 of July , by the direction of a physician , I undertook , by making a circular incision round the navel , to enlarge the orifice into the cavity of the abdomen , in order to extract the foetus that way : but the woman being very weak , and much emaciated , I could now only take off the scapula .

The solubility of these salts in aqueous potash has been rather variously stated by Lowig and Frankland , and also their characters as odorous arid irnodorous .	The truth is , that unless the salts of stanethyl are formed from the oxide , they are almost always contaminated with the above - mentioned oilv chloride , the oxide of which is soluble in potash .

He proceeds to explain , that the most violent of Fires is no other than this Fermentation in the most rapid manner , the said Principles furiously driving up each other ; alleging , for the evidencing hereof , the Experiment of taking of Spirit of Venice Turpentine four ounces , and of Aqua - fortis six ounces , both recently drawn , which , being mixed together in a Glass viol , will presently fall into a furious fermentation , arising to that height , as actually , among the thick fumes , to burn and blaze out of and above the outside of the Glass in a visible flame .	And thus he would have all actual Flagrations , whether from the violent assaults of fiery Acido - sulphureous Liquors ( as in the newly recited Experiment ) or from Acids and Sulphurs , set in to intestine conflicts in combustible concretes , ( as in all usual fire , ) to be no other than his described Fermentation in a most violent hurry , the principles acting furiously upon each other ; whilst other slower fires are maintained by slighter and more gentle touches of the same principles .

The spermaceti does not become rancid , or putrid , nearly so soon as the other animal oils ; which is most probably owing to the spermaceti being for the most part in a solid state ; and I should suppose , that few oils would become so soon rancid as they do , if they were always preserved in that degree of cold which rendered them solid : neither does this oil become so soon putrid as the flesh of the animal ; and therefore , although the oil in the cells appeared to be putrid before boiling , it was sweet when deprived of the cellular substance .

There is a variety in some species of this animal which is , I believe , peculiar to this order ; that is , the want of the sense of smelling ; none of those which I have yet examined having that sense , except the two kinds of Whalebone Whale : such of course have neither the olfactory nerves , nor the organ ; therefore , in them , the nostrils are intended merely for respiration ; but others have the organ placed in this passage as in other animals .

The membranous portion of the posterior nostrils is one canal ; but when in the bony part , in most of them , it is divided into two ; the Spermaceti Whale , however , is an exception .
ro1882	olfactory|olfactory	nerves	olfactory|olfactory								These substances are nearly in the same proportion as in the human brain .	The two lateral ventricles are large , and in those that have olfactory nerves are not continued into them as in many quadrupeds ; nor do they wind so much outwards as in the human subject , but pass close round the posterior ends of the thalami nervorum opticorum .	The thalami themselves are large ; the corpora striata small ; the crura of the fornix are continued along the windings of the ventricles , much as in the human subject .
ro1882	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The whole brain in the Piked Whale weighed four pounds ten ounces .	The nerves going out from the brain , I believe , are similar to those of the quadruped , except in the want of the olfactory nerves in the genus of the Porpoise .	The medulla spinalis is much smaller in proportion to the size of the body than in the human species , but still bears some proportion to the quantity of brain ; for in the Porpoise , where the brain is largest , the medulla spinalis is largest ; yet this did not hold good in the Spermaceti Whale , the size of the medulla spinalis appearing to be proportionally larger than the brain , which was small when compared to the size of the animal .
ro1882	smell								by a mode of impregnation|by the vibration of different mediums|by the different powers of refraction of different mediums		The organs of sense , which appear to be adapted to every mode of life , are those of touch and taste ; but those of smell , sight , and hearing , probably require to be varied according to circumstances .	Thus smell may be increased by a mode of impregnation , hearing by the vibration of different mediums , and sight by the different powers of refraction of different mediums ; therefore , as animals are intended by nature to be differently circumstanced , so are the senses formed .	Of the Sense of Touch .
ro1882	smelling						In this tribe of animals				Of the Sense of Smelling .	In this tribe of animals there is something very remarkable in what relates to the sense of smelling ; nor have I been able to discover the particular mode by which it is performed .	When we consider these animals as quadrupeds , and only constructed differently in external form for progressive motion through water , we must see that it was necessary that all the senses should correspond with this medium : we must therefore be at a loss to conceive how they smell , since we may observe , that the organ for smelling water , as in fish , is very different from that formed to smell air ; and as we must suppose this tribe are only to smell water , being the medium in which such odoriferous particles can be diffused , we should expect their organ to be similar to that of fish ; but in that case nature would have been obliged to have attached the nose of a fish to an animal constructed like a quadruped ; and it is contrary to the laws which are established in the animal creation to mix parts of different animals together .

It might be supposed , that they could smell the air on the surface of the water by every inspiration , as animals do on land ; and probably they may : but this will not give them the power to smell the odoriferous particles of their prey in the water at any depth ; and as their organ is not fitted to be affected by the application of water , and as they cannot suck water into the nostril , without the danger of its passing into the lungs , it cannot be by its application to this organ that they are enabled to smell .

If the above solution is just , then only those which have the organ of smell can spout , a fact worthy of enquiry .	The organ of smell would appear to be less necessary in these animals than in those which live in air , since some are wholly deprived of it ; and the organ in those which have it is extremely small , when compared with that of other animals , as well as the nerve which is to receive the impression , as was observed above .
ro1885	smell	It|of|of inflammable air									But it is an objection to this hypothesis , that the inflammable air produced in this manner burns blue , and not at all like that which is produced from iron , or any other metal , by means of an acid .	It has also the smell of that kind of inflammable air which is produced from vegetable substances .	Besides , oil of vitriol without water , will not dissolve iron ; nor can inflammable air be got from it , unless the acid be considerably diluted ; and when I mixed brimstone with the chalk , neither the quality nor the quantity of the air was changed by it .
ro1885	smell	a fresh cabbage leaf|the leaf|of putrefaction									In repeating this experiment , care must be taken to draw away all the dead leaves from about the plant , lest they should putrefy , and affect the air .	I have found that a fresh cabbage leaf , put under a glass vessel filled with common air , for the space of one night only , has so far affected the air , that a candle would not burn in it the next morning , and yet the leaf had not acquired any smell of putrefaction .	1 Finding that candles burn very well in air in which plants had grown a long time , and having had some reason to think , that there was something attending vegetation , which restored air that had been injured by respiration , I thought it was possible that the same process might also restore the air that had been injured by the burning of candles .

That this restoration of air was not owing to any aromatic effluvia of these two plants , not only appeared by the essential oil of mint having no sensible effect of this kind ; but from the equally complete restoration of this vitiated air by the plant called groundsel , which is usually ranked among the weeds , and has an offensive smell .	This was the result of an experiment made the 16th of July , when the plant had been growing in the burned air from the 8th of the same month .

Inflammable air , when it is made by a quick process , has a very strong and offensive smell , from whatever substance it be generated ; but this smell is of three different kinds , according as the air is extracted from mineral , vegetable , or animal substances .	The last is exceedingly fetid ; and it makes no difference , whether it be extracted from a bone , or even an old and dry tooth , or from soft muscular flesh , or any other part of the animal .

The last is exceedingly fetid ; and it makes no difference , whether it be extracted from a bone , or even an old and dry tooth , or from soft muscular flesh , or any other part of the animal .	The burning of any substance occasions the same smell : for the gross fume which arises from them , before they flame , is the inflammable air they contain , which is expelled by heat , and then readily ignited .

If a quantity of inflammable air be contained in a glass vessel standing in water , and have been generated very fast , it will smell even through the water , and this water will also soon become covered with a thin film , assuming all the different colours .	If the inflammable air have been generated from iron , this matter will appear to be a red okre , or the earth of iron , as I have found by collecting a considerable quantity of it ; and if it have been generated from zinc , it is a whitish substance , which I suppose to be the calx of the metal .
ro1885	smell		offensive|much stronger								Inflammable air , made by a violent effervescence , I have observed to be much more inflammable than that which is made by a weak effervescence , whether the water or the oil of vitriol prevailed in the mixture .	Also the offensive smell was much stronger in the former case than in the latter .	The greater degree of inflammability appeared by the greater number of successive explosions , when a candle was presented to the neck of a phial filled with it .

But one quantity of inflammable air , which I had set by in May 1771 , along with the others above mentioned , had had some putrid flesh in it ; and this air had lost its inflammability , when it was examined at the same time with the other in the December following .	The bottle in which this air had been kept , smelled exactly like very strong Harrowgate water .

They are affected in the same manner , when they are killed in any other kind of noxious air that I have tried , viz .	fixed air , inflammable air , air filled with the fumes of brimstone , infected with putrid matter , in which a mixture of iron filings and brimstone has stood , or in which charcoal has been burned , or metals calcined , or in nitrous air , & amp ; c .

If a mouse ( which is an animal that I have commonly made use of for the purpose of these experiments ) can stand the first shock of this stimulus , or has been habituated to it by degrees , it will live a considerable time in air in which other mice will die instantaneously .
ro1885	effluvium		noxious						loaded by animal respiration|absorbed by standing without agitation in fresh or salt water		In these , my guide has generally been to consider the influences to which the atmosphere is , in fact , exposed ; and , as some of my unsuccessful trials may be of use to those who are disposed to take pains in the farther investigation of this subject , I shall mention the principal of them .	The noxious effluvium with which air is loaded by animal respiration , is not absorbed by standing without agitation in fresh or salt water .	I have kept it many months in fresh water , when , instead of being meliorated , it has seemed to become even more deadly , so as to require more time to restore it , by the methods which will be explained hereafter , than air which has been lately made noxious .

I have even spent several hours in pouring this air from one glass vessel into another , in water , sometimes as cold , and sometimes as warm , as my hands could bear it , and have sometimes also wiped the vessels many times , during the course of the experiment , in order to take off that part of the noxious matter , which might adhere to the glass vessels , and which evidently gave them an offensive smell ; but all these methods were generally without any sensible effect .	The motion , also , which the air received in these circumstances , it is very evident , was of no use for this purpose .

Among other experiments , I tried a great variety of different effluvia , which are continually exhaling into the air , especially of those substances which are known to resist putrefaction ; but I could not by these means effect any melioration of the noxious quality of this kind of air .	Since air tainted with animal or vegetable putrefaction is the same thing with air rendered noxious by animal respiration , I shall now recite the observations which I have made upon this kind of air , before I treat of the method of restoring them .
ro1885	smell	They|they	equally noxious|offensive								of air are , in fact , the same thing , I conclude from their having several remarkable common properties , and from their differing in nothing that I have been able to observe .	They equally extinguish flame , they are equally noxious to animals , they are equally , and in the same way , offensive to the smell , they are equally diminished in their quantity , they equally precipitate in limewater , and they are restored by the same means .	Since air which has passed through the lungs is the same thing with air tainted with animal putrefaction , it is probable that one use of the lungs is to carry off a putrid effluvium , without which , perhaps , a living body might putrefy as soon as a dead one .

Since air which has passed through the lungs is the same thing with air tainted with animal putrefaction , it is probable that one use of the lungs is to carry off a putrid effluvium , without which , perhaps , a living body might putrefy as soon as a dead one .	When a mouse putrefies in any given quantity of air , the bulk of it is generally increased for a few days ; but in a few days more it begins to shrink up , and generally , in about eight or ten days , if the weather be pretty warm , it will be found to be diminished 1 / 6 , or 1 / 5 of its bulk .

This may be owing to the fixed air being transferred from the putrid mouse into the water , and yet it is evident that there is a putrid effluvium entirely distinct from this kind of air , and which has very different properties .	It is a doubt with me , however , whether the putrid effluvium be not chiefly fixed air , with the addition of some other effluvium , which has the power of diminishing common air .

The resemblance between the true putrid effluvium and fixed air in the following experiment , which is as decisive as I can possibly contrive it , appeared to be very great ; indeed , much greater than I had expected .

I put a dead mouse into a tall glass vessel , and having filled the remainder with quicksilver , and set it , inverted , in a pot of quicksilver , I let it stand about two months , in which time the putrid effluvium issuing from the mouse had filled the whole vessel , and part of the dissolved blood , which lodged upon the surface of the quiksilver , began to be thrown out .

I then filled another glass vessel , of the same size and shape , with as pure fixed air as I could make , and exposed them both , at the same time , to a quantity of lime - water .
ro1885	effluvium		putrid								This , at least , would have been the consequence , if the mouse itself had putrefied in any quantity of air .	It seems to depend , in some measure , upon the time , and other circumstances , in the dissolution of animal or vegetable substances , whether they yield the proper putrid effluvium , or fixed , or inflammable air ; but the experiments which I have made upon this subject , have not been numerous enough to enable me to decide with certainty concerning those circumstances .	Putrid cabbage , green , or boiled , infects the air in the very same manner as putrid animal substances .

Putrid cabbage , green , or boiled , infects the air in the very same manner as putrid animal substances .	Air thus tainted is equally contracted in its dimensions , it equally extinguishes flame , and is equally noxious to animals ; but they affect the air very differently if the heat that is applied to them be considerable .
ro1885	effluvium		of						by quicksilver		If beef or mutton , raw , or boiled , be placed so near to the fire , that the heat to which it is exposed shall equal , or rather exceed , that of the blood , a considerable quantity of air will be generated in a day or two , about 1 / 7th of which I have generally found to be absorbed by water , while all the rest was inflammable ; but air generated from vegetables , in the same circumstances , will be almost all fixed , and no part of it inflammable .	This I have repeated again and again , the whole process being in quicksilver ; so that neither common air , nor water , had any access to the substance on which the experiment was made ; and the generation of air , or effluvium of any kind , except what might be absorbed by quicksilver , or resorbed by the substance itself , might be distinctly noted .	A vegetable substance , after standing a day or two in these circumstances , will yield nearly all the air that can be extracted from it , in that degree of heat ; whereas an animal substance will continue to give more air or effluvium , of some kind or other , with very little alteration , for many weeks .

That the putrid effluvium will mix with water seems to be evident from the following experiment .	If a mouse be put into a jar full of water , standing with its mouth inverted in another vessel of water , a considerable quantity of elastic matter ( and which may , therefore , be called air ) will soon be generated , unless the weather be so cold as to check all putrefaction .

After a short time , the water contracts an extremely fetid and offensive smell , which seems to indicate that the putrid effluvium pervades the water , and affects the neighbouring air ; and since , after this , there is often no increase of the air , that seems to be the very substance which is carried off through the water , as fast as it is generated ; and the offensive smell is a sufficient proof that it is not fixed air .	For this has a very agreeable flavour , whether it be produced by fermentation , or extracted from chalk by oil of vitriol ; affecting not only the mouth , but even the nostrils , with a pungency which is peculiarly pleasing to a certain degree , as any person may easily satisfy himself who will chuse to make the experiment .

If the water in which the mouse was immersed , and which is saturated with the putrid air , be changed , the greater part of the putrid air will , in a day or two , be absorbed , though the mouse continues to yield the putrid effluvium as before ; for as soon as this fresh water becomes saturated with it , it begins to be offensive to the smell , and the quantity of the putrid air upon its surface increases as before .	I kept a mouse producing putrid air in this manner for the space of several months .

Air thus generated from putrid mice standing in water , without any mixture of common air , extinguishes flame , and is noxious to animals , but not more so than common air only tainted with putrefaction .	It is exceedingly difficult and tedious to collect a quantity of this putrid air , not miscible in water , so very great a porportion of what is collected being absorbed by the water , in which it is kept ; but what that proportion is , I have not endeavoured to ascertain .

Insects of various kinds live perfectly well in air tainted with animal or vegetable putrefaction , when a single inspiration of it would have instantly killed any animal .

I have even been frequently obliged to take plants out of the putrid air in which they were growing , on purpose to brush away the swarms of these insects which infected them ; and yet so effectually did some of them conceal themselves , and so fast did they multiply , in these circumstances , that I could seldom keep the plants quite clear of them .	When air has been freshly and strongly tainted with putrefaction , so as to smell through the water , sprigs of mint have presently died , upon being put into it , their leaves turning black ; but if they do not die presently , they thrive in a most surprising manner .

Since the plants that I made use of manifestly grow and thrive in putrid air ; since putrid matter is well known to afford proper nourishment for the roots of plants ; and since it is likewise certain that they receive nourishment by their leaves as well as by their roots , it seems to be exceedingly probable , that the putrid effluvium is in some measure extracted from the air , by means of the leaves of plants , and therefore that they render the remainder more fit for respiration .	Towards the end of the year some experiments of this kind did not answer so well as they had done before , and I had instances of the relapsing of this restored air to its former noxious state .

Accordingly I resumed the experiments in the summer of the year 1772 , when I presently had the most indisputable proof of the restoration of putrid air by vegetation ; and as the fact is some importance , and the subsequent variation in the state of this kind of air is a little remarkable ; I think it necessary to relate some of the facts pretty circumstantially .

The air , on which I made the first experiments , was rendered exceedingly noxious by mice dying in it on the 20th of June .	Into a jar nearly filled with one part of this air , I put a sprig of mint , while I kept another part of it in a phial , in the same exposure ; and on the 27th of the same month , and not before , I made a trial of it , by introducing a mouse into a glass vessel , containing 21 / 2 ounce measures filled with each kind of air ; and I noted the following facts .
ro1885	noxious|noxious		highly noxious|noxious					on the 19th of this			Franklin and Sir John Pringle happened to be with me , when the plant had been three or four days in this state , and took notice of its vigorous vegetation , and remarkably healthy appearance in that confinement .	On the 30th of the same month , a mouse lived fourteen minutes , breathing naturally all the time , and without appearing to be much uneasy , till the last two minutes , in air which had been rendered noxious by mice breathing in it almost a year before , and which I had found to be most highly noxious on the 19th of this month , a plant having grown in it , but not exceedingly well , these eleven days ; on which account , I had deferred making the trial so long .	This restored air was affected by a mixture of nitrous air , almost as much as common air .
ro1885	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid	air							This restored air was affected by a mixture of nitrous air , almost as much as common air .	As this putrid air was thus easily restored to a considerable degree of fitness for respiration , by plants growing in it , I was in hopes that by the same means it might in time be so much more perfectly restored , that a candle would burn in it ; and for this purpose I kept plants growing in the jars which contained this air till the middle of August following , but did not take sufficient care to pull out all the old and rotten leaves .	The plants , however , had grown , and looked so well upon the whole , that I had no doubt but that the air must constantly have been in a mending state ; when I was exceedingly surprised to find , on the 24th of that month , that though the air in one of the jars had not grown worse , it was no better , and that the air in the other jar was so much worse than it had been , that a mouse would have died in it in a few seconds .
ro1885	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid	air							It also made no effervescence with nitrous air , as it had done before .	Suspecting that the same plant might be capable of restoring putrid air to a certain degree only , or that plants might have a contrary tendency in some stages of their growth , I withdrew the old plant , and put a fresh one in its place ; and found that , after seven days , the air was restored to its former wholesome state .	This fact I consider as a very remarkable one , and well deserving of a farther investigation , as it may throw more light upon the principles of vegetation .

The strong thriving state of your mint in putrid air seems to show that the air is mended by taking something from it , and not by adding to it .

' ' Having rendered inflammable air perfectly innoxious by continued agitation in a trough of water , deprived of its air , I concluded that other kinds of noxious air might be restored by the same means ; and I presently found that this was the case with putrid air , even of more than a year ' s standing .

As these agitations were made in jars with wide mouths , and in a trough which had a large surface exposed to the common air , I take it for granted that the noxious effluvia , whatever they be , were first imbibed by the water , and thereby transmitted to the common atmosphere .	In some cases this was sufficiently indicated by the disagreeable smell which attended the operation .

After I had made these experiments , I was informed that an ingenious physician and philosopher had kept a fowl alive twenty - four hour , in a quantity of air in which another fowl of the same size had not been able to live longer than an hour , by contriving to make the air , which it breathed , pass through no very large quantity of acidulated water , the surface of which was not exposed to the common air ; and that even when the water was not acidulated , the fowl lived much longer than it could have done , if the air which it breathed had not been drawn through the water .

In order to judge more precisely of the effect of these different methods of agitating air , I transferred the very noxious air , which I had not been able to amend in the least degree by the former method , into an open jar , standing in a trough of water ; and when I had agitated it till it was diminished about one third , I found it to be better than air , in which candles had burned out , as appeared by the test of the nitrous air ; and a mouse lived in 2 1 / 4 ounce measures of it a quarter of an hour , and was not sensibly affected the first ten or twelve minutes .	In order to determine whether the addition of any acid to the water , would make it more capable of restoring putrid air , I agitated a quantity of it in a phial containing very strong vinegar ; and after that in aqua fortis , only half diluted with water ; but , by neither of these processes was the air at all mended , though the agitation was repeated at intervals during a whole day , and it was moreover allowed to stand in that situation all night .

ro1885	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid	air							Perhaps the residuum of fixed air may be another instance of the same nature .	Fixed air is equally diffused through the whole mass of any quantity of putrid air with which it is mixed ; for dividing the mixture into two equal parts , they were reduced in the same proportion by passing through water .	But this is also the case with some of the kinds of air which will not incorporate , as inflammable air , and air in which brimstone has burned .

If fixed air tend to correct air which has been injured by animal respiration or putrefaction , limekilns , which discharge great quantities of fixed air , may be wholesome in the neighbourhood of populous cities , the atmosphere of which must abound with putrid effluvia .	I should think also that physicians might avail themselves of the application of fixed air in many putrid disorders , especially as it may be so easily administered by way of clyster , where it would often find its way to much of the putrid matter .

Nothing is to be apprehended from the distention of the bowels by this kind of air , since it is so readily absorbed by any fluid or moist substance .
ro1885	noxious|noxious	fixed air	noxious|noxious								Nothing is to be apprehended from the distention of the bowels by this kind of air , since it is so readily absorbed by any fluid or moist substance .	Since fixed air is not noxious per se , but , like fire , only in excess , I do not think it at all hazardous to attempt to breathe it .	It is however easily conveyed into the stomach , in natural or artificial Pyrmont water , in briskly fermenting liquors , or a vegetable diet .
ro1885	smell	of the volatile spirit of vitriol	very strong	it							Air thus diminished is not heavier , but rather lighter than common air ; and though lime - water does not become turbid when it is exposed to this air , it is probably owing to the formation of a selenitic salt , as was the case with the simple burning of brimstone abovementioned .	That something proceeding from the brimstone strongly affects the water which is confined in the same place with this brimstone , is manifest from the very strong smell that it has of the volatile spirit of vitriol .	I conclude the diminution of air by this process is of the same kind with the diminution of it in the other cases , because when this mixture is put into air which has been previously diminished , either by the burning of candles , by respiration , or putrefaction , though it never fails to diminish it something more , it is , however , no farther than this process alone would have done it .
ro1885	smelled	it	very offensively					presently			If a fresh mixture be introduced into a quantity of air which had been reduced by a former mixture , it has little or no farther effect .	I observed , that when a mixture of this kind was taken out of a quantity of air in which a candle had before burned out , and in which it had stood for several days , it was quite cold and black , as it always becomes in a confined place ; but it presently grew very hot , smoaked copiously , and smelled very offensively ; and when it was cold , it was brown , like the rust of iron .	I once put a mixture of this kind to a quantity of inflammable air , made from iron , by which means it was diminished 1 / 9 or 1 / 10 in its bulk ; but , as far as I could judge , it was still as inflammable as ever .
ro1885	smell	of it	very pungent|offensive								Air diminished by this mixture of iron filings and brimstone , is exceedingly noxious to animals , and I have not perceived that it grows any better by keeping in water .	The smell of it is very pungent and offensive .	The quantity of this mixture which I made use of in the preceding experiments , was from two to four ounce measures ; but I did not perceive , but that the diminution of the quantity of air ( which was generally about twenty ounce measures ) was as great with the smallest , as with the largest quantity .
ro1885	smell	of it	very strong|remarkable		very|resembling that of smoking spirit of nitre						One of the most conspicuous properties of this kind of air is the great diminution of any quantity of common air with which it is mixed , attended with a turbid red , or deep orange colour , and a considerable heat .	The smell of it , also , is very strong , and remarkable , but very much resembling that of smoking spirit of nitre .	The diminution of a mixture of this and common air is not an equal diminution of both the kinds , which is all that Dr .
ro1885	putrid|putrid|noxious|noxious		putrid|putrid|highly noxious|noxious	air							I could not tell with certainty by means of mice , whether it was at all injured with respect to respiration ; and yet if nitrous air may be depended upon for furnishing an accurate test , it must be rather more than one third worse than common air , and have been diminished by the same general cause of the other diminutions of air .	For when , after many trials , I put one measure of thoroughly putrid and highly noxious air , into the same vessel with two measures of good wholesome air , and into another vessel an equal quantity , viz .	three measures of air in which a candle had burned out ; and then put equal quantities of nitrous air to each of them , the former was diminished rather more than the latter .
ro1885	smell|smells	of nitrous air	peculiar		like common air				Nitrous air		The glass jar , in which the air and this mixture have been confined , has generally been so much heated in this process , that I have not been able to touch it .	Nitrous air thus diminished has not the peculiar smell of nitrous air , but smells just like common air in which the same mixture has stood ; and it is not capable of being diminished any farther , by a fresh mixture of iron and brimstone .	Common air saturated with nitrous air is also no farther diminished by this mixture of iron filings and brimstone , though the mixture ferments with great heat , and swells very much in it .
ro1885	smell	its	peculiar	the remainder							This remainder extinguished flame , and was noxious to animals .	Afterwards I diminished a pretty large quantity of it to one eighth of its original bulk , and the remainder still retained much of its peculiar smell , and diminished common air a little .	A mouse also died in it , but not so suddenly as it would have done in pure nitrous air .
ro1885	smell	of nitrous air|the water	peculiar|very manifest						In this operation		A mouse also died in it , but not so suddenly as it would have done in pure nitrous air .	In this operation the peculiar smell of nitrous air is very manifest , the water being first impregnated with the air , and then transmitting it to the common atmosphere .	This experiment gave me the hint of impregnating water with nitrous air , in the manner in which I had before done it with fixed air ; and I presently found that distilled water would imbibe about one tenth of its bulk of this kind of air , and that it acquired a remarkably acid and astringent taste from it .
ro1885	smell	of water	peculiarly pungent								This experiment gave me the hint of impregnating water with nitrous air , in the manner in which I had before done it with fixed air ; and I presently found that distilled water would imbibe about one tenth of its bulk of this kind of air , and that it acquired a remarkably acid and astringent taste from it .	The smell of water thus impregnated is at first peculiarly pungent .	I did not chuse to swallow any of it , though , for any thing that I know , it may be perfectly innocent , and perhaps , in some cases , salutary .
ro1885	fume	from bubbles of this air|some air bubbles	whitish	a quantity of water							This kind of air is retained very obstinately by water .	In an exhausted receiver a quantity of water thus saturated emitted a whitish fume , such as sometimes issues from bubbles of this air when it is first generated , and also some air bubbles ; but though it was suffered to stand a long time in this situation , it still retained its peculiar taste ; but when it had stood all night pretty near the fire , the water was become quite vapid , and had deposited a filmy kind of matter , of which I had often collected a considerable quantity from the trough in which jars containing this air had stood .	I have even let some of it stand more than a week , in phials with their mouths open , and sometimes very near the fire , without producing any alteration in it .
ro1885	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid								This , however , may probably be the case , as the spirit of nitre is in a considerable degree volatile .	It will perhaps be thought , that the most useful , if not the most remarkable , of all the properties of this extraordinary kind of air , is its power of preserving animal substances from putrefaction , and of restoring those that are already putrid , which it possesses in a far greater degree than fixed air .	My first observation of this was altogether casual .
ro1885	smell	mouse|it	offensive				I|I				In this case there was a considerable diminution , viz .	from 51 / 4 to 31 / 4 ; but not so great as I had expected , the antiseptic power of the nitrous air having checked the tendency to putrefaction ; for when , after a week , I took the mouse out , I perceived , to my very great surprise , that it had no offensive smell .	Upon this I took two other mice , one of them just killed , and the other soft and putrid , and put them both into the same jar of nitrous air , standing in the usual temperature of the weather , in the months of July and August of 1772 ; and after 25 days , having observed that there was little or no change in the quantity of the air , I took the mice out ; and , examining them , found them both perfectly sweet , even when cut through in all places .

That which had been put into the air when just dead was quite firm ; and the flesh of the other , which had been putrid and soft , was still soft , but perfectly sweet .

That which had been put into the air when just dead was quite firm ; and the flesh of the other , which had been putrid and soft , was still soft , but perfectly sweet .	In order to compare the antiseptic power of this kind of air with that of fixed air , I examined a mouse which I had enclosed in a phial full of fixed air , as pure as I could make it , and which I had corked very close ; but upon opening this phial in water , about a month after , I perceived that a large quantity of putrid effluvium had been generated ; for it rushed with violence out of the phial ; and the smell that came from it , the moment the cork was taken out , was insufferably offensive .

Indeed Dr .
ro1885	smell	of them both	the same				I				Four penny weights and seventeen grains of zinc dissolved in spirit of nitre , to which as much water was added , yielded about twelve ounce measures of air , which had , in some degree , the properties of nitrous air , making a slight effervescence with common air , and diminishing it about as much as nitrous trous air , which had been itself diminished one half by washing in water .	The smell of them both was also the same ; so that I concluded it to be the same thing , that part of the nitrous air which is imbibed by water being retained in this solution .	In order to discover whether this was the case , I made the solution boil in a sand heat .
ro1885	smell	of the nitrous air	peculiar|very sensible	The				for several days			From one trial that I made , I conclude that nitrous air may be kept in a bladder much better than most other kinds of air .	The air to which I refer was kept about a fortnight in a bladder , through which the peculiar smell of the nitrous air was very sensible for several days .	In a day or two the bladder became red , and was much contracted in its dimensions .

This air also , like that which had been infected with the fumes of charcoal , was in the highest degree noxious , made no effervescence with nitrous air , was no farther diminished by the mixture of iron filings and brimstone , and was not only rendered innoxious , but also recovered , in a great measure , the other properties of common air , by washing in water .	It might be suspected that the noxious quality of the air in which lead was calcined , might be owing to some fumes peculiar to that metal ; but I found no sensible difference between the properties of this air , and that in which tin was calcined .

It might be suspected that the noxious quality of the air in which lead was calcined , might be owing to some fumes peculiar to that metal ; but I found no sensible difference between the properties of this air , and that in which tin was calcined .	The water over which metals are calcined acquires a yellowish tinge , and an exceedingly pungent smell and taste , pretty much , as near as I can recollect , for I did not compare them together , like that over which brimstone has been frequently burned .

The water over which metals are calcined acquires a yellowish tinge , and an exceedingly pungent smell and taste , pretty much , as near as I can recollect , for I did not compare them together , like that over which brimstone has been frequently burned .	Also a thin and whitish pellicle covered both the surface of the water , and likewise the sides of the phial in which the calcination was made , insomuch that , without frequently agitating the water , it grew so opaque by this constantly accumulating incrustation , that the sun beams could not be transmitted through it in a quantity sufficient to produce the calcination .
ro1885	smell	Lime - water		the							I shall endeavour to do it at my leisure .	Lime - water never became turbid by the calcination of metals over it ; but the colour , smell , and taste of the water was always changed , and the surface of it became covered with a yellow pellicle , as before .	When this process was made in quicksilver , the air was diminished only one fifth ; and upon water being admitted to it , no more was absorbed ; which is an effect similar to that of a mixture of nitrous and common air , which was mentioned before .
ro1885	vapour						Spirit				To verify my hypothesis , I first put a small pot full of this kind of paint , and afterwards ( which answered much better , by exposing a greater surface of the paint ) I daubed several pieces of paper with it , and put them under a receiver , and observed , that in about twentyfour hours , the air was diminished between one fifth and one fourth , for I did not measure it very exactly .	Spirit of wine absorbs this vapour as readily as water itself , and is increased in bulk by that means .	Also , when it is saturated , it dissolves iron with as much rapidity , and still continues inflammable .
ro1885	smell	It	very disagreeable								Oil of olives absorbs this vapour very slowly , and , at the same time , it turns almost black , and becomes glutinous .	It is also less miscible with water , and acquires a very disagreeable smell .	By continuing upon the surface of the water , it became white , and its offensive smell went off in a few days .
ro1885	smell	its	offensive					in a few days			It is also less miscible with water , and acquires a very disagreeable smell .

ro1885	smell	of this air	exceedingly pungent|putrid								In the remainder a candle would not burn , and a mouse would have died presently .	The smell of this air was exceedingly pungent , but different from that of the putrid effluvium .	A mouse lived perfectly well in this air , thus affected with the acetous fermentation ; after it had stood several days mixed with four times the quantity of fixed air .
ro1885	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid	air							I even doubt not but that , in a certain state of the water , there might be no sensible difference in the bulk of the agitated air , and yet at the end of the process it would extinguish a candle , air being supplied from the water in the place of that part of the common air which had been absorbed .	It is certainly a little extraordinary that the very same process should so far mend putrid air , as to reduce it to the standard of air in which candles have burned out ; and yet that it should so far injure common and wholesome air , as to reduce it to about the same standard : but so the fact certainly is .	If air extinguish flame in consequence of its being previously saturated with phlogiston , it must , in this case , have been transferred from the water to the air .

November 6 , 1772 , a quantity of inflammable air , which , by long keeping , had come to extinguish flame , I observed to smell very much like common air in which a mixture of iron filings and brimstone had stood .	It was not , however , quite so strong , but it was equally noxious .

Bismuth and nickel are dissolved in the marine acid with the application of a considerable degree of heat ; but little or no air is got from either of them ; but , what I thought a little remarkable , both of them smelled very much like Harrowgate water .

As I generally made use of mice in the experiments which relate to respiration , and some persons may chuse to repeat them after me , and pursue them farther than I have done ; it may be of use to them to be informed , that I kept them without any difficulty in glass receivers , open at the top and bottom , and having a quantity of paper , or tow , in the inside , which should be changed every three or four days ; when it will be most convenient also to change the vessel , and wash it .

Reverend Sir , Having lately experienced the good effects of fixed air in a putrid fever , applied in a manner , I believe , not heretofore made use of , I thought it proper to inform you of the agreeable event , as the method of applying this powerful corrector of putrefaction took its rise principally from your observations and experiments on factitious air ; and now , at your request , I send the particulars of the case I mentioned to you , as far as concerns the administration of this remedy .	January 8 , 1772 , Mr .
ro1885	putrid|putrid	matter	putrid|putrid|putrid								The same putrid symptoms remained , and a subsultus tendinum came on : his stools were more faetid ; and so hot , that the nurse assured me she could not apply her hand to the bed - pan , immediately after they were discharged , without feeling pain on this account : The medicine and clysters were repeated .	Reflecting upon the disagreeable necessity we seemed to lie under of confining this putrid matter in the intestines , lest the evacuation should destroy the vis vitae before there was time to correct its bad quality , and overcome its bad effects , by the means we were using ; I considered , that , if this putrid ferment could be more immediately corrected , a stop would probably be put to the flux , which seemed to arise from , or at least to be increased by it ; and the fomes of the disease would likewise be in a great measure removed .	I thought nothing was so likely to effect this , as the introduction of fixed air into the alimentary canal , which , from the experiments of Dr .

His stools were less frequent ; their heat likewise and peculiar faetor were considerably diminished : his muttering was much abated , and the subsultus tendinum had left him .	Finding that part of the air was rejected when given with a bladder in the usual way , I contrived a method of injecting it which was not so liable to this inconvenience .

He took nourishment to - day , with pleasure ; and , in the afternoon , sat up an hour in his chair .

Fevers of the putrid kind have been so rare in this town , and in its neighbourhood , since the commencement of the present year , that I have not had an opportunity of trying again the effects of fixed air , given by way of clyster , in any case exactly similar to Mr .

I tried to penetrate the Os Tincae with the End of my Finger , but could not ; however , I so far opened it , as to let out a sort of bloody Ichor , which was a little offensive in Smell .	I asked her , if , when her Discharges were so large as to wet her Seat , they differed in Smell from those which came in less Quantities ; and if they smelled something like what then came from her when I searched her , which she answered in the Affirmative : From whence I concluded she had an Ulcer cer just within the Os Uteri , from the Edge of which this Fungus or Excrescence grew .

ro1907	Scent		small								The Town of Newbury , at the Mouth of Merrimack River , about forty Miles North East from Boston , is the Place that seems to have been the Center of the Shock and Shakes felt by us .	There the Earth opened and threw up many Cart - loads of a fine Sand and Ashes , mixed with some small Remains of Sulphur ; but so small , that taking up some of it in my Fingers , and dropping it into a Chafin - dish of bright Coals , in a dark Place , once in three Times the blue Flame of the Sulphur would plainly arise , and give a small Scent , and but a small one .	By this it seems evident that it was a sulphurous Blast which burst open the Ground , and threw up the calcined bituminous Earth .

How long it was before it began to stink I am not certain ; I know it did not at first , and I believe it was covered with Snow till a little while before : There is nothing of Smell now .

In respect of the ether , I have since found that the process is satisfactory ; for when I purposely added ether vapour to air , so as to increase its bulk by one - third , treatment like that above removed it , so as to leave the air of its original volume : There was yet a slight odour of ether left , but not so much as that conferred by adding one volume of the vapour of ether to 1200 or 1500 volumes of air .	I find that when air is expanded 1th or ? rd more by the addition of the vapour of ether , washing first of all with about 1 - th of its volume of water , then again with about as much water , and lastly with its volume of water , removes the ether to such a degree , that though a little smell may remain , the air is of its original volume .

As already stated , it is the presence of other and more volatile hydrocarbons than olefiant gas , which the tensions obtained seemed to indicate , both in the gas and the liquid resulting from its condensation .
ro1929	odour		slight difference|imperceptible				to an inexperienced nose				It has all the properties of the oily bases in general .	From aniline it is distinguished by a slight difference in the odour , perhaps imperceptible to an inexperienced nose , by a higher boiling - point and a lower specific gravity .	Ethylaniline boils ( from platinum ) constantly at 2040 , the boiling - point of aniline being 182 ? ; the specific gravity of this base is 0 ' 954 at 18 ? , that of aniline being 1 ' 020 at 16 ? .
ro1929	odour		very characteristic aniseed						Addition of potassa		On adding however water and distilling off the excess of bromide of ethyl , it was found that the chloraniline had been converted into a hydrobromate , which was held in solution , scarcely a trace of uncombined base being left .	Addition of potassa to the solution of the hydrobromate separated at once a yellow oily base , of a very characteristic aniseed - odour , differing from chloraniline in many respects .	It remained liquid even at the temperature of a cold winter day , while chloraniline is distinguished by the facility with which it crystallizes .
ro1929	odour	its			the preceding compound				On decomposing		There was no doubt that a second equivalent of ethyl had been assimilated .	On decomposing the hydrobromate with potassa , an oil separated resembling , in its appearance and also in its odour , the preceding compound .	An attempt to purify the ethylochloraniline from the potassa by distillation with water having failed , on account of the high boiling - point of this substance , the purification of the diethylochloraniline , for as such the new compound was to be considered , was at once effected with ether .
ro1929	odour	Methylaniline	peculiar|somewhat different		that of aniline				when		The action of the latter compound upon aniline is very remarkable , the evolution of heat , on mixing the two substances , being so great , that the liquid enters into violent ebullition , so that unless the substances be Inixed gradually , the crystalline hydriodate , which is formed immediately , is actually thrown out of the vessel .	Methylaniline , when separated from the hydrobromate or hydriodate , appears as a transparent oil of a peculiar odour , somewhat different from that of aniline , and boiling at 1920 ; it has retained the properties of aniline in a higher degree than the ethylated compound .	This substance yields still the blue coloration with hypochlorite of lime , although in a less degree than aniline .

Methylethylaniline resembles the preceding base in its odour , but has no longer any action upon hypochlorite of lime .	I had not prepared a sufficient quantity of the compound for a determination of the boiling - point .

It is distinguished , at the common temperature , by a very agreeable , somewhat roselike odour , rather an unusual property for an amyl - compound ; however , it does not deny its origin , for on heating the base the disgusting odour of the fusel - alcohol appears but slightly modified .	Amylaniline boils constantly at 258 ? , or 54 = 3 X 18 ? higher than ethylaniline .

The new basic compound , when separated and purified in the usual manner , resembles the preceding base , especially with respect to odour .	Its salts are so insoluble in water that at the first glance one is almost inclined to doubt the basicity of the substance , inasmuch as the oil appears to be perfectly insoluble in dilute hydrochloric and sulphuric acids .

ro1965	smelling|nauseous|nauseous		nauseous|nauseous	the Filaments of the			the Sensorium|the Animal				It is easy therefore to explain whence the acuteness of the Sensation of this Animal may proceed ; for as the Nervus Olfactorius has a large Space and Bounds wherein to be dispersed , viz .	the two Cavities of the Proboscis , which are both long and large , so that scarce any Columna aeris can enter them , but some one or another of the Filaments of the Nervus Olfactorius dispersed in these Cavities must be touched , whereby the Idea of smelling must be conveyed to the Sensorium commune in a more intense Degree , and the Animal soon become sensible of whatever approaches that is noxious or nauseous to it , and thereby is taught how to avoid it ; so this Structure , for a quick conveyance and long continuance of the Sound , is a great means both to make the Elephant soon receive the Sound and have a deep impression of it .	The Aqueduct is a flat Tube or Pipe , whose Orifice is so situated betwixt the two forementioned Cavities , that if there be any superfluous Humidity contained in them , it must needs be discharged ( at least in this Animal ) into the Mouth ; for as it is situated where the first Cavity terminates , so the second , from a broader and more superficial bay yyyyy2 ginning , ginning must needs discharge its Moisture , by its more narrow and deeper termination , into this receptacle ; also it descends directly towards the Mouth , passing through the Scull below the hole for the Jugular Vein ( mm ) betwixt the hole for the Carotid Artery , ( pp ) and that for the Arteria durae matris ( qq ) whence descending ( nn ) it is joyn ~ d with its Fleshy part , which discharges it self into the Mouth on each side , behind the back part of the inner Teeth of the upper Jaw .

Some vitriolic acid , dropped on a little of this residuum , yielded a smell of nitrous acid , the same as when dropped on nitre phlogisticated by exposure to the fire in a covered crucible ; but it was thought less strong .

It is easily known by its large duskish bell - flower ; but if not in the flower , the remarkable noisome smell of the leaf , somewhat narcotic , if once known , will ever after discover it .	Some time before this accident , we had a proof of the effect of the yew - tree upon some of our horses : they were put into an orchard , where they cropped the branches of these trees , and about four hours after , without any previous symptom of disorder , dropped down , and after a struggle of a minute or two died .

The person having the plague may be said to have a contagious and poisonous air in his room and about him , while at the same time the open air is free from any dangerous exhalations ; so that I never was afraid to go into any large house , wherein a plaguy person lived , provided that he was confined to one room .

Next , the patient has a violent head - ach and giddiness , with some slight convulsive motions : he breathes hard ; his breath and sweat stink ; his eyes are ruddy , he looks frighted , sad , and pale ; he has an insatiable thirst ; his tongue is yellowish , with a red border ; he has a total loss of appetite , restlessness , great inward heat , and more than could be expected from the fever , which is sometimes pretty moderate , but grows stronger frequently towards night : the patient very often bleeds at the nose .	He continues in that dismal condition for some days , until the venomous matter begins to be separated in some measure from the blood , and discharge itself critically upon the surface by the cutaneous eruptions of buboes , carbuncles , blains , petechial spots , and some small vesicles or blisters : but all these symptoms are not to be looked for in the same person .

In order , in the next place , to inform you of the state of the peritonaeum and abdominal viscera , I made a crucial incision thro ' the integuments and muscles of the abdomen , carrying the longitudinal section from the cartilago ensiformis to the os pubis , and the transverse from the right side of the regio lumbaris thro ' the umbilicus to the left ; and as the abdomen had been so long exposed to the air , its integuments and muscles , except the aponeuroses in immediate contact with the peritonaeum , which had undergone no material alteration , were grown very black , dry , hard , and like rotten timber void of smell , and mouldering into dust .	On div ding the peritonaeum , which throughout its whole extent was of a natural colour , sound , firm , smooth , and extensible , I found the omentum nearly in a similar state to that of the membrana adiposa , full an inch thick , and extended to the lower part of the hypogastrium .

ro2276	smell	they	nauseous|bituminous								I shall conclude this paper with observing the several particulars , in which all the species of the bituminous fossils before - mentioned resemble each other .	They seem to be generally found between beds of clay , or stone ; are of a dark brown , or black colour , of a laminated texture : pliable when moist , and fresh dug , but crisp and brittle when dry ; full of cracks , and easily breaking transversely ; they all sink in water , and emit the same nauseous and bituminous smell ; they differ in being more or less solid , heavy , and inflammable , according to the proportions and principles of which they consist ; and if any doubt could remain of their being a mineral substance , it must be removed by the following analysis .	One pound of Bovey coal , of the woody kind , powdered , put into a glass retort , and distilled in sand , yielded four ounces and a half of phlegm , which had the appearance of common water , but somewhat of a bituminous smell and taste ; near four ounces of a turbid whitish bituminous liquor , of an intolerable faetid smell , and extremely pungent to the tongue ; about two drachms of a heavy bituminous matter , which would not mix with the liquor above - mentioned , but sunk entirely to the bottom , and ( which is very remarkable ) there was not the least appearance of any light oil floating on the bituminous liquor .

The The ashes of this fossil , when burnt , being boiled in water , and the water evaporated , there remained no salt behind .
ro2277	vapour		dense				I		when the mixture of air had been confined by water		I always observed , that , presently after every explosion , the vessel was filled with a dense vapour , so that it was sometimes impossible to see through it ; and before I admitted the external air , I could pour it from one end of the vessel to the other , and it seemed to fall almost as fast as a feather in a common vacuum , and in general it did not disappear in less than ten minutes .	I even found this dense vapour when the mixture of air had been confined by water .	The smell of the vessel , after the process , was that of the most offensive kind of inflammable air from iron .

The smell of the vessel , after the process , was that of the most offensive kind of inflammable air from iron .	From these experiments it was sufficiently evident , that something more than water had been produced ; and pouring into the vessel a quantity of the juice of litmus , it was instantly turned to a deep red ; so that it was equally evident , that an acid had been formed .

The Child was Corrupted and stunk much , so did the Lochia , which flowed three Weeks ; soon after they ceased , the Menstrua appeared , and the Woman went abroad : About six Weeks after her Delivery , she was seized with violent Convulsions , and Hysteric Firs , which lasted near three Days ; when a painful Tumor arose in the left side of her Belly , which ended in an Eruption of white thick Matter near a Pint , with small Knobs of a Substance like the Yolk of boiled Eggs : All Symptoms immediately vanished , only she complained of the great Hollowness where the Tumor had been .	Four Days after this , the like Swelling appeared on the right side of her Belly , which continued with a small Flux of Matter about five or six Months , in despite of the many Remedies ~ I used to cure her .
ro2288	putrid|putrid|smell	from the corpse	putrid|putrid	moisture							Girls and unmarried women wear six or eight large rings of thick brass wire about their neck , and great numbers of tin rings in their ears ; but all these ornaments are laid aside when they marry .	They often preserve the dead bodies of their Radjas ( by which name they call every freeman that has property , of which there are sometimes one , sometimes more , in one Compong , and the rest are vassals ) for three months and upwards before they bury them : this they continue to do by putting the body into a coffin well caulked with dammar ( a kind of rezin ) : they place the coffin in the upper part of the house , and having made a hole at the bottom , fit thereto a piece of bamboo , which reaches quite through the house , and three or four feet into the ground : this serves to convey all putrid moisture from the corpse without occasioning any smell .	They seem to have great ceremonies at these funerals ; but they would not allow me to see them .

Hence 100 gr .

ro2306	smell	its	different								PRIESTLEY , also by means of marine air , or bitumens or bituminous substances , all of which may be made to yield it ; or metallic substances , as zinc and regulus of arsenic , both of which are inflammable ; but neither of them is so when deprived of its inflammable air : this is , therefore , the true and only principle of inflammability in any substance .	I acknowledge that the inflammable air , proceeding from almost all these substances , is exceeding impure ; that it contains from some a mixture of aerial acid or of oil , and from all some part of the substance which yields it or expels it , and hence its smell is different , according to the class of the substances from which it is extracted ; but it is equally true , that none of these substances contribute to its inflammability ; on the contrary , it is so much the less inflammable ( that is , requires so much more air to be mixed with it before it flames ) as it contains more of these heterogeneous substances .	Hence inflammable air of the morasses is never totally consumed * ; and , on the contrary , * 15 Roz .
ro2306	smell								when the quantity of inflammable air is considerable		196 .	Water also easily imbibes common air : when , therefore , inflammable air is agitated in water having a communication with the atmosphere , the inflammable air must necessarily be diminished by reason of its absorbtion , and the part so absorbed immediately escapes out of the water into the atmosphere , as is evident by the smell which is perceived when the quantity of inflammable air is considerable .	This escape gives room for the further absorbtion of the inflammable air which then escapes in the same manner .
ro2306	vapour|smell								when it is not strongly heated		This was also devised by STAHL , and followed by BRANDT and NEWMAN , and by it they determined the proportion of phlogiston to that of acid to be nearly as 1 to 16 .	But during the formation of the liver of sulphur , whether in the moist or dry way , much of the phlogiston and acid is dissipated , as is evident by the vapour and smell that proceed from it , their alkali also contained fixed air , which it lost during the operation , and of which they kept no account , as they were ignorant of its existence ; and the tartar vitriol formed by them or sal polycreste retained much undecomposed sulphur , as always happens when it is not strongly heated ; so that this method also was very imperfect , however some sub1 sequent sequent chemists who made the experiment with more care concluded from it , that sulphur contained one - seventh of phlogiston .

I also found that , notwithstanding the snow in the glass had so frequently been changed , and though the fungi had sometimes been not more than three or four days in the snow , the water , after the snow was dissolved , always acquired the same disagreeable smell and taste as the original water imported from Baffin ' s Bay .	The above described experiments I attempted to repeat on a larger scale , and for that purpose I employed a glass of about twelve cubic inches in contents .
ro2310	smell						nature				The nerves which supply this organ are very large in proportion to the size of the animal .	Considering this curious structure of the nose in an animal which lives in water , it is natural to conclude that nature has fitted it for discovering its prey in that element , by means of the sense of smell ; and that for this purpose it is enabled to introduce this prominence into the small recesses in which its natural food is probably concealed .	It is very sparingly soluble in water , and insoluble in alcohol and ether .

When heated it neither melts nor sublimes , but becomes purple , from the production of ammonia , and then burns gradually without any particular odour .	It unites with the metallic oxides ; and when aided by heat , expels carbonic acid from the alkaline carbonates .

In most instances , on the very commencement of this process , a small jar of the air thus collected discovers by the smell a nitrous impregnation .	But it sometimes happens , that several jars of air may be collected , and the admission of atmospherical air to them will not produce a sensibly red colour .

The residuum of the alum had a strong hepatic smell , and contained particles of perfectly formed sulphur .	Most of these experiments , if not all , were repeated in earthen tubes instead of gun - barrels , and with the same success .

It burns like paper , but with a weaker and quicker flame , as if a great part of its oil had been before exhausted : and its smell in burning discovers nothing of the pungency of volatile salts , but proves it to be a purely vegetable substance .	Each of these observations confirms Mr .
ro2375	deodorized	The urine									The process consists in passing urine , after having been filtered in order to separate all insoluble matter which may have been deposited , through animal charcoal in an ordinary percolating apparatus .	The urine is thereby completely decolorized and deodorized , a small quantity of charcoal producing this effect on a large quantity of urine .	The charcoal , after being thoroughly washed with water , is treated with boiling alcohol , to which it communicates a bright yellow colour like * Irradiation would cause bands of the same thickness to appear thinnest in the more brilliant spectrum .

The clear solution was evaporated to perfect dryness , and the residue gently heated until it fused to a clear thin liquid , free from films upon its surface ; it evolved a trace of acid vapour during the process , and did not corrode the platinum vessel .

I took 100 grains of the recently and well - dried double fluoride ( which soon attracts a little moisture from the air ) , and heated it gently with constant motion in a platinum dish until it was all fused ; it evolved an acid odour , and lost 0 ' 8 grain in weight .	I now again slowly fused it , gradually increasing the heat until at an incipient red heat it was quite solid and evolved no more acid odour , then cooled it under a cover and weighed quickly ; its loss was now increased to 25 - 57 grains , the calculated theoretic loss of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid being 25 ' 59 grains , assuming the salt to be KF , HF .

The acid obtained in my experiments also I consider to be destitute of oxygen , not only from the results obtained in the various analyses and experiments already described , but also , 1st , because the double fluoride of hydrogen and potassium from which the acid was prepared , when fused and electrolyzed with platinum electrodes , evolved abundance of inflammable gas at the cathode , but yielded no gas at the anode , although oxides are by electrolysis decomposed before fluorides ; 2nd , the electrolysis of the anhydrous acid with platinum electrodes ' yielded no odour of ozone , whereas hydrofluoric acid containing various percentages of water evolved that odour strongly ( see page 199 ) ; 3rd , the properties of hydrofluoric acid prepared by heating pure fluoride of silver in pure hydrogen ( see pages 181 & amp ; 182 ) agreed in properties , as far as those properties were ascertained , with the acid obtained from the double salt ; and 4th , because two volumes of gaseous anhydrous hydrofluoric acid were produced by the reaction of one volume of hydrogen upon its equivalent of fluoride of silver , whereas if lNote , added 3May 25 , 1869 .

By employing forty SMEE ' S elements the conduction was copious ; the anode rapidly corroded , and much finely divided platinum as a greyish - black powder collected in and beneath the paraffin cup ; this powder appeared to be due to detached particles of the redbrown crust becoming reduced by the diffused bubbles of free hydrogen from the cathode , or was composed of particles of metal mechanically detached from the anode by the current .
ro2385	odour|odour	it	special|feeble|the intense		somewhat like that of chlorine				on removing the charcoal from the liquid		The cracking of the charcoal was attended by evolution of numerous bubbles of gas ( probably air previously absorbed by the carbon ) ; on this account , and also in consequence of the fume developed by the heat of conduction - resistance in the charcoal , it was difficult to ascertailn if the anode evolved gas due to electrolysis ; nevertheless , with the aid of a strong light and watching for opportunities , it was found that the passage of the current was not attended by any distinct increase of gas from the anode .	No special odour could be detected above the anodes , but on removing the charcoal from the liquid it evolved a feeble odour somewhat like that of chlorine , in addition to the intense one of the acid .	The kinds of wood employed for making the charcoal were beech , kingwood , ebony , lignum - vitEe , box , mahogany , zebra , Memel oak , English oak , rosewood , maple , lancewood , walnut , Norwegian pine , and ironwood .
ro2385	odourless|odourless	gas	odourless|odourless								The product was a colourless fuming liquid , much less fuming than anhydrous hydrofluoric acid , and did not corrode paraffin or platinum , but corroded vulcanized indiarubber rapidly .	This liquid was electrolyzed by means of six SMEE ' S elements and two large platinum electrodes , during five hours , the liquid being in a covered narrow and deep platinum cup immersed in a freezing - mixture ; conduction occurred freely , and an odourless gas ( doubtless ordinary oxygen ) was freely evolved from the anode ; the anode was not corroded , and both electrodes were unaltered in weight .	520 grains of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid was distilled from about 2000 grains of KF , HF in a platinum retort through a platinum tube surrounded by the freezing - mixture into a platinum bottle ( surrounded by the same mixture ) containing 334 ' 17 grains of fibrous sulphuric anhydride ; the first contact of the two substances was attended by a hissing sound and evolution of great heat , and the resulting compound was a colourless liquid , of a less fuming character than either of the two substances alone .
ro2385	odour								in commercial hydrofluoric acid		Any excess of liquid above the ball was absorbed by application of sponge previous to weighing .	Sulphurous acid is frequently present in commercial hydrofluoric acid to such an extent as to be readily detected by the odour ; it may be easily found by adding shavings of metallic tin to the acid .	Tin was found to be much better than zinc ; it produced a cloud of sulphur at once , and evolved sulphuretted hydrogen readily .

ro2385	odour		very strong		like that of ozone						by means of six SMEE ' S cells , a platinumfoil anode , and a platinum crucible cathode .	Gas was liberated freely from each electrode , and a very strong odour like that of ozone was evolved .	No corrosion of either electrode took place during twelve hours ' action .
ro2385	odour	of ozone	powerful								The acid thus obtained was electrolyzed by ten SMEE ' S cells with platinum electrodes in a narrow and deep platinum cup , the cup being the negative pole .	Copious conduction occurred ; a powerful odour of ozone was evolved , indicating decomposition of the water and evolution of oxygen gas at the anode ; much gas was liberated , and doubtless consisted chiefly of hydrogen .	Heat was evolved in the liquid by the conduction - resistance .
ro2385	smell	of ozone							if the battery was weak|on first contact		The anode dissolved , but not very rapidly ; in three hours it lost 1 ' 58 grain , and indicated the simultaneous decomposition of the acid with that of the water , the latter being the greatest in amount .	The smell of ozone disappeared if the battery was weak , and reappeared on first contact .	In a further eleven hours the anode lost 5 ' 05 grains , and was covered with a blackish crust ; this crust was partly soluble in water to a brownish solution .
ro2385	odour	it|of ozone									hydrofluoric acid by platinum electrodes and ten SMEE ' S cells , the liquid being mixed with other pure acids .	With equal volumes of hydrofluoric acid and concentrated nitric acid , gas was evolved freely from the anode ; it had no odour of ozone , and was probably ordinary oxygen .	No gas was visible at the cathode ; the liberated hydrogen was doubtless absorbed by the nitric acid .
ro2385	fumes								on addition of water		No gas was visible at the cathode ; the liberated hydrogen was doubtless absorbed by the nitric acid .	Only a trace of platinum was dissolved during sixteen hours ' action ; the liquid was then pale yellow , but became dark green , evolved abundance of red - brown fumes , and became hot on addition of water .	With equal volumes of aqueous hydrofluoric and strong hydrochloric acids , much chlorine was evolved from the anode and hydrogen from the cathode ; this agrees with the usual results , that chlorides ( as well as oxides ) are decomposed before fluorides , and hydrochloric acid before water in electrolysis .
ro2385	odour	of ozone	strong			from the			With equal volumes of aqueous hydrofluoric and strong sulphuric acids		Only a trace of chloride of platinum was formed at the anode in four hours , and the anode was not visibly corroded .	With equal volumes of aqueous hydrofluoric and strong sulphuric acids much gas and a strong odour of ozone was evolved from the anode ; hydrogen also from the cathode .	The anode corroded very slowly , without being covered with an insoluble film , and the liquid became cloudy with suspended particles , which were light brown at first , then brown , and after many hours ' action nearly black .

No odour of ozone occurred until a large quantity of red and black selenium ( probably nearly all ) was deposited upon the sides and bottom of the platinum cup , then ozone occurred strongly .	The anode was not visibly corroded in twenty - eight hours ' active electrolysis .

The solution was filtered and evaporated to a small bulk ; it then fumed densely : the odour was like that of hydrofluoric acid , and when cold the liquid was odourless and of a somewhat oily consistence .	The final liquid evolved a little heat on adding water to it .

These experiments afford evidence of the wide difference between the animal oxide above described and the acid sublimate of SCHEELE .

Where these waters run , they deposit oily particles , which , by degrees , join together , and form a soft , spongious , greenish - yellow substance , one inch almost in thickness , which is called muffa : this , when dry , is wrinkled , takes fire , crackles , and gives the smell of brimstone , and when entirely burnt , leaves a black ash behind .	I immersed a piece of silver in these waters , which , in a few minutes , became black .

By Boiling , when they take strong Vessels not quite filled , outting them into a cellar , wherein they make first a mild fire , and then increase it , and after a while lessen it , that so the boiling may cease by little and little of it self ; which is performed in 36 or 40 hours , according to the bigness of the vessel .

Discoursing of the Baccharach - wine in particular , he notes , that it differs from other Rhenish wines in colour , odor , taste and virtue .	After its working it hath first a luteous colour , which they render limpid by ichthyocolla ( being very Alcalical ) cut , and kept infused in rain - water for 10 or 12 hours ; and then torn into small pieces , and so put into some Wine , and therewith shaken twice every day , till it be quite dissolved ; which is done in 6 or 7 days .

Besides , if a Person was desirous of being persumed from Head to Foot , nothing more was necessary than being electrized with a Glass Vessel lined with Balsam of Peru , Benjamin , or some such Drug ; and from this Electrization the Odours were perceptible for two or three Days , even so much as to incommode those to whom these Smells were disagreeable .

This Experiment was the Transmission of Odours along a Chain , or an iron Bar electrized .	One of us prepared and applied a little Piece of Linen , covered with Balsam of Peru , upon the iron Bar , which received the Electricity from the Globe : We fastened to this Rod the End of an iron Chain , which was electrized by Communication ; and we expected , that the Odour of the Balsam would be transmitted to the other End of the Chain , to which was hung a Ball of Metal .

I carried with me to Venice the same Curiosity , and the same Desire of being instructed , upon the Subject of the Transmission of Odours from medicated Tubes , and of the Cures , or of being relieved from Disorders almost suddenly , by the electrical Power .	One of my first Cares was , to find out some Friends or Acquaintance of M .

Mr .

Secondly , with regard to the Purging by Electricity , he had in his House a Man and Maid - Servant , who had been purged in this manner : That at least these two Persons had felt the same Effects as though they had taken Physic ; after having been electrized in M .

But how can we reconcile these two things , the almost never failing Operation of lined Tubes , upon so many Distempers which are said to have been cured , or considerably relieved , on one Part , and on the other the Transmission so very seldom to be perceived of the Odours of the Drugs enclosed in those Glasses , with * Page 28 ~ Un tale dileguamento succedutomi in un cylindro , non mi e poi veramente succeduto in altri , di quali mi son servito per vary ~ .	~ Si consumo la materia interna a segno , che siridusse non ostante l ' essere quasi ermeticamente serato alla sottiliezza di un delicato foglio di carta , e come un capo morto , che no tenea piu odore ni sapore , e fino il vetro medesimo quasi consunto si apri da se stesso in piu sissure per longo .

And why do they not communicate themselves by their Odour to all Persons , who are penetrated thereby by means of Electrification ? Will they say , that the Electricity , specifically operating upon their medical Virtue , separates it from their odoriferous Quality ? Miserable Subterfuge ! Which does not merit to be opposed seriously ; and the more so , as it is by the Transfusion of their Odours , that they pretend to be assured of the Efficacy of their lined Tubes .

By what Caprice then am I made more difficult of believing what passed in Italy than in other Countries , if the Phenomenon , which are pretended to have been seen there , could have been repeated ; or if the Testimonies , which they offered me , were not considerably weakened , or entirely abolished , when , being in the Places themselves , I was in a Condition of knowing their just Value ? Had I only consulted my personal Interest , to whom would it have been more convenient than to me , to have adopted these Novelties ? If they were real , they would have been so many evident Proofs of a Principle ~ , by which I have endeavoured to account for the electrical Phenomenon : A Principle , which as yet has sufficiently well served me , and which , having offered itself to Mr .

In regard to Mines , the Machine must prove of excellent Use ; for as the Damps ( either fulminating , which taking Fire , destroy the Men and ruin the Works , or arsenical , which kill by their poisonous Nature ) are some specifically lighter , and some specifically heavier than common Air , this centrifugal Wheel can in a little Time drive down Air through wooden Trunks ( or Launders ) of seven Inches bore , in such Quantities into the deepest Mines , as to cause all the light Damp to come out at the Top of the Pit ; or , by only altering two Sliders , suck away all the heavy poisonous Damp , whilst wholesome Air goes down from above Ground into the Pit , so as to fill all the subterraneous Caverns with fresh and wholesome Air .

JEremiah Skelton , who lived with his Father Daniel Skelton , at Warley in the Vicaridge of Hallifax in Yorkshire , observing a Storm coming , said , I think it will be Rain , I will go and gather in some of the Corn ( a late Harvest , which has been very unkindly in some parts of the North ) which was out at a Farm they had in the Cold Edge , about a Quarter of a Mile from their own Dwelling ; while at this Work , bringing in a Burden and casting it upon the Barn - Floor , the Tempest begun gun as he came forth again ; whereupon he stepped aside for shelter within the Barn Door , and while there , was struck with a dreadful Flash of Fire ; a young Woman that lived with her Father in the House , that belonged to this Farm , being sadly affrighted with the Thunder and Lightning ( for part of the Sulphurous Matter came down the Chimney , and filled the House with a strong Scent , like that of Gunpowder after firing ) she leaves the House , and not seeing the young Man about the Barn , goes with speed and tells the Family he was related to , that she feared he was slain .	They came to the Barn and found it even so : A sad Spectacle , the young Man cast down and many Stones about him ; he was laid upon his Face , wholly naked , save a small part of his Shirt about his Neck , and a very little of a Stocking upon one Foot , and so much of a Coat - sleeve as covered the Wrist of one Arm , his Clogs driven from his Feet , one not to be found , and the other Cloven , his Hat not to be found aster search , and the rest of his Garments torn into small Shreds , and cast at considerable distances one bit from another , the Hair of his Head and Beard singed as tho ' it had been with a Candle , and a little Hole below his left Eye , which they supposed might be made with the Fall upon a Stone , for there was a great Breach made upon the Barn , the Door tops , both of Stone , broken , and the wall above them fallen , with the Slate and WaterTables .
ro2524	scent		bad|so noisome				we			that we could not endure it	October the 2d .	We departed from Esree , about an hour or an hour and an half after Midnight , and in six hours and an half arrived at two Wells , the water 18 fathom and two foot deep , known by the name of Imp malcha Giub : through , the greatest part of this Stage we had a broad beaten Road , and where that was not discernible , we guided our selves by a ridge of Chalky Hills , under which the Wells lay ; the Water we found exceeding bad , and of so noisome a scent , that we could not endure it so much as at our Noses ; which made our Guide laugh at us , who told us , the Arabs , and even the King himself used to drink freely of it ; which , I am sure , our Horses would not do , though they were under a necessity of drinking that or none : For our selves , we had brought from Esree Water sufficient for one day at least .	In our way hither we were shown the true Plant which they burn for SoapAshes , which has no Leaves , but a soft juicy Stalk shooting into several Branches , and something resembling our Sanphire , only it ' s more round than that ; the Ashes likewise we saw , which were made not far from the Wells , which in burning run into Cakes , not much unlike the Cinders of a Forge , only they are heavier , and not so full of pores , nor so hard as they are .

ro2562	smell		slight sulphureous				I				late had occasion to return to the study of these bodies , and to make an observation which I beg leave to communicate to the Royal Society .	Near my house was an old well , about one hundred yards from the river , and about four yards deep , which had been many years disused on account of the badness of the water , which I found to contain much vitriolic acid , with , at the same time , a slight sulphureous smell and taste ; but did not carefully analyse it .	The mouth of this well was about four feet above the surface of the river ; and the ground , through which it was sunk , consisted of a black , loose , moist earth , which appeared to have been very lately a morass , and is now covered with houses built upon piles .
ro2570	stinks	the Fish	so extremely|so					soon			You will observe the in - sides of the shells are of an Oriental and Pearly Colour and substance like a flat Pearl , especially when first opened ; and I was told by an ingenious Person living upon the place , that he had observed in some shells under the first Coat a Liquor that was very orient and clear , that would move upon the Pressure of the Finger , but that such a Muscle never had Pearl , which Liquor I should think was the true Mother of Pearl .	The part where the Pearl lies is the Toe or lesser end , at the extremity of the Gut , and out of the body of the Fish between the two Films or Skins that line the shell : I was careful to leave one Pearl in its Bed ; but the Fish stinks so extremely and so soon , and shrunk into nothing , that I fear it will be hard to preserve the parts entire for the Inspection .	I believe that this Pearl answers to the Stone in other Animals , and certainly like that increases by several Crusts growing over one another , which appears by pinching the Pearl in a Vice , and the upper Coat will crack and leap away ; and this Stone is cast off by the Muscle , and voided as it is able ; and many shells that have had Pearls in them are found now to have none , which will appear by these instances .
ro2578	odour	Ammonia boric ethide	aromatic								The analysis of the body thus formed leads to the formula NI - , + B ( C , 4 11 ) , .	Ammonia boric ethide is a somewhat oily liquid possessing an aromatic odour and an alkaline reaction .	It cannot be distilled , except in vacuo , without decomposition .
ro2578	odour	Boric methide	peculiar|intolerably pungent						at ordinary temperatures	irritating the mucous membrane and provoking a copious flow of tears	The formation of boric methide under these circumstances proves conclusively that the corresponding ethyl compound is formed , not by the removal of the whole of the oxygen from boracic ether , but by the actual substitution of the three atoms of oxygen in boracic acid by three atoms of ethyl ; whilst boric methide is in like manner produced by the similar substitution of methyl for oxygen , which is quite in harmony with the mode of formation of very numerous compounds in the organo - nretallic family .	Boric methide exists at ordinary temperatures as a colourless and transparent gas possessing a peculiar and intolerably pungent odour , irritating the mucous membrane and provoking a copious flow of tears .	Its specific gravity is 1 93137 .
ro2578	odour	of boric ethide|boric methide	peculiar pungent								Thus when these bodies issue very slowly from a glass tube into the air , they burn with a lambent blue flame invisible in daylight , and the temperature of which is so low that a finger may be held in it for some time without much inconvenience .	Under these circumstances partial oxidation only takes place , and it is to the products thus formed that the peculiar pungent odour of boric ethide and boric methide is due .	When , on the other hand , these bodies issue into the air more rapidly , the lambent blue and nearly cold flame changes to the green and hot flame above mentioned .
ro2578	odour|smell	They|of ammonia|of boric methide	very peculiar								Ammonia boric methide is deposited from its ethereal solution in magnificent arborescent crystals , which rapidly volatilize without residue when exposed to the air .	They possess a caustic and bitter taste and a very peculiar odour , in which both the smell of ammonia and that of boric methide can be recognized .	Ammonia boric methide fuses at 56 ? Cent .
ro2604	odours|vapour	of ozone|of water							on radiant heat		A column of ammoniacal gas , moreover , 3 feet long , was found sensibly impervious to the heat employed in the inquiry , while the vapours of many of the volatile liquids were proved to be still more opaque to radiant heat than even the most powerfully acting permanent gases .	In this second investigation , the discovery of dynamic radiation and absorption is also announced and illustrated , and the action of odours and of ozone on radiant heat is made the subject of experiment , The third paper * of the series to which I have referred was devoted to the examination of one particular vapour , which on account of its universal diffusion possesses an interest of its own - I mean of course the vapour of water .	In this paper I considered all the objections which had been urged against my results up to the time when the paper was written ; I replied to each of them by definite experiments , removing them one by one , and finally placing , as I believe , beyond the pale of reasonable doubt the action of the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere .

ro2605	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								Agreeably to this view , therefore , we should expect to find in those orders in which the umbilical vesicle is largest and most permanent , and the placenta least 3A2 359 vascular , a corresponding simplicity of the cerebral organ ; and accordingly we do find that the brain in the Cheiroptera and Rodenta resembles that of the Bird in the smoothness of the cerebral hemispheres and their limited extent , the cerebellum being wholly uncovered by the cerebrum throughout these orders * .	Among the Marsupiata , the Opossums and Dasyures present a still simpler form of the brain , the cerebral hemispheres being equally devoid of convolutions as those of the Beaver , and leaving the bigeminal bodies as well as the cerebellum uncovered : the fissure also which separates the olfactory tract from the superimposed cerebral mass , instead of being inferior , as in the Rodenaa , is here lateral : and , lastly , the proportions which the thickness of the medullary covering bears to the extent of the lateral ventricles is less than in any other mammiferous order .	With respect to the brain of the Kangaroo , it must be observed , that although shortly after birth it resembles in structure the brain of the lowest Vertebrata , yet it afterwards assumes a more complex form than that of the Opossums or Dasyures , there being a few symmetrical anfractuosities upon the cerebral hemispheres , which also cover a greater proportion of the bigeminal bodies : the hemispheres are , however , more contracted anteriorly , and have a smaller size , in proportion to the body , than in those of the Rodentia .
ro2615	smell				from amylic alcohol						iodide of hexyl .	The identity of our product with iodide of hexyl was shown by its analysis , and by the following reactions : Digested with water and oxide of silver , it yields an oily liquid lighter than water , differing completely in smell from amylic alcohol , and having the composition of hexylic alcohol .	Its analysis gave carbon 70 21 per cent .
ro2615	odour	iHexylene	very penetrating								When caustic potash and common alcohol are employed instead of oxide of silver with water , a different result occurs ; the iodide splits up into hexylene and hydriodic acid , which latter reacts upon the potash .	iHexylene prepared by this process is an oily liquid , lighter than water , of very penetrating odour , and boiling at about 68 ? C .	Its constitution was proved on the one hand by its analysis and vapourdensity , and on the other by its deportment with bromine , upon which it reacts with extreme violence , combining without evolution of HBr , and yielding a heavy liquid , whose composition , ascertained by analysis , is oC H , , Br , .

In this state of the water , I observed bubbles of air to rise from it , and especially in one place , to which some shelves , that I had in it , directed them ; and having set an inverted glass vessel to catch them , in a few days I collected a considerable quantity of this air , which issued spontaneously from the putrid water ; and , putting nitrous air to it , I found that no change of colour or diminution ensued , so that it must have been , in the highest degree , noxious .

These facts certainly demonstrate , that air which either arises from stagnant and putrid water , or which has been for some time in contact with it , must be very unfit for respiration ; and yet Dr .	ALEXANDER ' S opinion is rendered so plausible by his experiments , that it is very possible that many persons may be rendered secure , and thoughtless of danger , in a situation in which they must necessarily breathe it .

This sort of Liquor ( it seems ) you found in the Pouch of the Female , which , like this , had more of the peculiar Faetor of this Animal , than any other part besides ; for on removing these Parts with the Skin about the Clo ~ , I was freed from the ungrateful Smell of it .	On separating the Skin from the Muscles of the Abdomen , the two above - mentioned Bones ( peculiar , I believe , to this Animal ) appeared , from whence some Muscles sprang , and were inserted to the Ossa Femorum , which performed the Office of the Psoas Muscles in other Animals , which last named Muscles were much smaller in this than in other Creatures .

I have distilled five pints of that Water ; the distilled Water has not had any Taste nor Smell , and it has not changed the Tincture of Turnsol , neither the Lime - Water .	There remained from that Five Pints ( or One hundred and sixty Ounces ) Seventy Grains of Residue ; the which , by Lixivium has given to me Fifty - five Grains of grey Earth , and Fifteen Grains of white Salt , almost like Sal gemmae .

It appears by the Smell of that Water , that it contains a Sulphur very subtle , which dissipates its self very easily , and which is not sensible in the Experiments .	It is nevertheless to be attributed to that Sulphur , the principal Effects which they do attribute to that Mineral Water , as of helping in the Palsy , & amp ; c .

The filtrated liquor is of a greenish - brown colour ; it has a peculiar smell , and a sweetish taste .	It leaves on evaporation a brown substance , which is soluble in alcohol , nearly soluble in boiling water , and very little acted upon by sulphuric ether .
ro2644	smell	it	peculiar		more resembling aniTal than vegetable bodies				when burned		The substance obtained by either of these means , possesses the properties of a resin in greater perfection than guaiacum ; it is equally 0so1 ble in alcohol and sulphuric ether , insoluble in water , & amp ; c .	; but when burned it emits a peculiar smell , more resembling aniTal than vegetable bodies .	If , however , fresh portions of nitric acld be added three or four times successively ; or if a larLre quantity be employed to form the solution ; the product obtained by evaporation is then of a very dillffrent nature ; for it has lost all the characteristic properties of a resin , having become equally soluble in water and alcohol ; the solution of it in this state having an astringent bitter taste .

I wish I had seen the Beginning of this uncommon Phenomenon , the Duration of which , I think , might be half a Minute , and made the House stink , as if a Gun had been fired in it .	My Canal bears East and West , and the Fellow says he heard it coming from the West , bringing the Leaves of some tall Trees from an adjacent Field in its Passage ; but could not discover any material or substantial Body to fall in the Water , where the Hissing , as I observed above , was very loud and violent ; neither was there any Lightning or Thunder before or after , but the Day remained bright , still , and hot .

After this all these Insects died and stunk very much .	They begun this Year to hatch in the Month of April , and some there are , that are not yet hatched .

On August the 11th , at Twelve of the Clock , I first observed a stinking Mist , like a thick Cloud , but of short duration ; but at Four a Clock it returned from the North West , so very thick , that it perfectly darkned the Air , and hindered the Sight .

I must confess , that I am my self of a Phlegmatic Constitution , and very inclinable to such an Excretion ; and if at any time I smell or taste any thing nauseous , I am forced to void Spittle in great quantities ; which very often happened to me during this Plague , when I had been in Places where the Smell was far from being agreeable .	But yet I cannot say , that this Spitting ( which in me proceeds naturally , in others must be excited by Medicines , ) was any ways profitable to me to prevent my being infected ; by Reason that the Pestilential Venom does more infect the Spirits and Mass of Blood , than the Lymph from which the Salva is separated .

The space occupied by them both , immediately upon mixture , is noted down , as also the time by a watch : after standing the appointed time ( half an hour , except where it is mentioned otherwise ) the space then occupied is marked down , which being deducted from the first gives the result of diminution sought for : for example , an ounce phial of air from a putrid plumb , with the addition of half of nitrous air , took up the space of 195 ( part of the first being absorbed by the water in its passage through it ) ; after half an hour , still 195 ; so that no diminution following , it was known to be mephitic .	August 30th , the same quantity of the air of my garden , with the nitrous , occupied 205 ; after half an hour it was diminished to 145 , which being deducted gave 60 , the state of the air that day ; and so of the rest .

Being left together twenty - four hours longer , the air was reduced to 10 ~ , or rendered nearly mephitic ; yet the flesh was not putrid , only smelling rather faint and musty .	It is evident from hence , that something had escaped from the flesh , whilst yet void of any putrid smell , so as to render the air very noxious : I suppose this effluvia to be pure phlogiston .

ro2709	effluvia		vegetable	upon							XII .	The following experiments were made to discover the effects of vegetable effluvia upon air .	These facts are very curious , interesting , and convincing .
ro2709	noxious	vegetables									These facts are very curious , interesting , and convincing .	It is amazing , that vegetables , whilst fresh and free from the least degree of putrescency , should have such a noxious tendency as to spoil the air , and render it not only useless but fatal to animal life , and that in so short a time .	We have here a striking example of the necessity of faithful experiments : by them alone we can add certainty to science , and develop nature in her most secret and abstruse operations ; and as she is unchangeable in herself , every discovery extorted from her is immutable .
ro2709	effluvia	rotten vegetables|of rotten vegetable matters									We have here a striking example of the necessity of faithful experiments : by them alone we can add certainty to science , and develop nature in her most secret and abstruse operations ; and as she is unchangeable in herself , every discovery extorted from her is immutable .	For want of attention to this laborious but sole method of coming at truth , it is a pretty general opinion in the world , that even rotten vegetables are little noxious : and a late author , whom I only mention because his book is pretty generally read , in a chapter upon putrid fevers and infection , expressly says : ` ` The effluvia of rotten vegetable matters have little effect in contaminating the air ; from some experiments it appears , that they possess rather an antiseptic virtue .	' ' We know , however , by fatal experience , that both animal and vegetable substances , when in a corrupted state , are the obvious sources of the most dreadful and alarming diseases , from the mildest putrid fever up to the plague itself .
ro2709	putrid|putrid	a quantity of corrupted|cabbages|other vegetables	putrid|putrid								Sir JOHN PRINGLE gives us an instance of the jail or hospital - fever , caused by the infection of a gangrened limb .	A dreadful fever was caused at Venice by a quantity of corrupted fish ; and at Delft by putrid cabbages and other vegetables .	Many instances of this kind may be brought , by which countries have been almost depopulated .
ro2709	smell		cadaverous				we				But it is no wonder that animal and vegetable matter , when in a state of absolute corruption , should be pregnant with such dreadful effects .	Instinct leads us to fly from the danger when we perceive the cadaverous smell .	The ninth , tenth , twelfth , and thirteenth experiments demonstrate , that our senses are by no means capable of distinguishing infection , nor , by warning us of the danger , of leading us to avoid it .

They show , that both animal and vegetable matter , when perfectly fresh , sweet , and devoid of putrescency , exhales somewhat of a very noxious nature , inducing a putrid state in the living body , which proves destructive to animal life .	Hence I do not hesitate to declare , that in jails , hospitals , and other crowded places , we ought not by any means to estimate their wholesomeness by the absence of disagreeable smells alone .

Hence I do not hesitate to declare , that in jails , hospitals , and other crowded places , we ought not by any means to estimate their wholesomeness by the absence of disagreeable smells alone .	The principle of disease may lurk therein unperceived by our limited senses .

Such was the effects of animal effluvia in a close and unventilated place in the space of eleven hours , that , out of one hundred and forty - six souls , no more than twenty - three came out alive , and those in a high , putrid fever , of which , however , by fresh air , & amp ; c .	they gradually recovered .
ro2709	smell		disagreeable			In hospitals	the wards				In all confined places , in proportion to their airyness , we find more or less of this .	In hospitals , though the wards may give no marks of it by any apparent dirtyness or disagreeable smell , we may observe its effects ; diseases which usually admit in private practice of an easy cure , are often very tedious , and apt to assume anomalous symptoms .	Healthy persons , admitted for the cure of recent wounds and other accidents , soon become pale , lose their appetite , and are generally discharged weak and emaciated , but soon recover by the benefit of fresh air .
ro2709	effluvia	of vegetables	equally poisonous						even whilst perfectly sweet and fresh		Such and many more are the effects of bad air , which , though not virulent enough to cause a putrid fever in its more malignant form , is yet sufficient to excite it to such a degree as to undermine the constitutions of the patients , and render the disorders , for which they were admitted , anomalous , tedious , and fatal .	We have demonstrated , that the effluvia of vegetables , even whilst perfectly sweet and fresh , are equally poisonous with those from animal substances .	The vegetables were separated from their parent plant , consequently not in a growing or vegetating state .
ro2709	odorous|odorous	of vegetables|their|particles	odorous|odorous						in the twelfth experiment		XV .	In order to find whether any part of the pernicious effects of vegetables upon air in the twelfth experiment might be owing to their odorous particles , the following experiments were made .	In each , the quantity of enclosed air was eight ounces ; the time of standing together sixteen hours .

For where any difference occurred , it is so small , that I attribute it rather to some little inaccurracy in conducting the experiment .

Nor did I think it necessary to repeat the trials , being satisfied that their poisonous effects in the twelfth and thirteenth experiments were not in the least owing to their odour , but to their organized structure , tending to dissolution from the time they are deprived of nourishment ; such is the perfect agreement between vegetable and animal substances .	It is demonstrable from hence , that the filling of rooms with nose - gays and bunches of flowers is by no means a safe practice , especially in close rooms or sick chambers ; their effluvia are of so noxious a nature as quickly to render the air unfit for the purposes of respiration , and cannot fail of having bad effects upon sick and valetudinary people in particular .

Two ounces of the black stinking mud of the foss was put into the eight - ounce phial of air ; being closed , they were suffered to remain together twelve hours .	The air in twelve trials being put to the test , the results were as follow .

Hence it is evident , that bogs and marshy grounds , when dry , or perfectly drained of their moisture , become healthy , and emit no noxious exhalations .	This illustrates the observation , that such situations are not liable to produce their peculiar diseases during the dry seasons , or after being well drained .

The ingenious Mr .

The air had then contracted a noisome smell , like a new - cleaned ditch , and was diminished from 62 ~ to 49 ~ .	Several experiments gave the same results : on standing longer , it was diminished from 62 ~ to 29 ~ .
ro2709	effluvia		putrid						prevented by too much moisture		The air being then tried by the test , it was in no instance found farther diminished than from 62 ~ to 56 ~ .	This experiment was made with a view of discovering the effect of marshes and bogs when laid under water ; and we find that their danger is in a great measure obviated by it : so that the putrid fermentation is either prevented by too much moisture , or the effluvia are absorbed in passing through the superincumbent bed of water : perhaps the cold generated by evaporation may have some effect .	This fully proves the propriety of Sir JOHN PRINGLE ' S remark , where , in giving cautions for avoiding diseases arising from putrid air , he says , ` ` As for cantonments in marshy grounds , if the troops must remain there in the dangerous season , it will be better to float the fields entirely , than to leave them half dry ; for the shallower the water the more it will corrupt , and the evaporation will be greater in proportion .

Sea : The Hogs of that Country loving these Eggs , devour also great quantities of them , and thereby help to purge the Land of them ; which is often so molested by this Vermin , that they enter into their Houses and Beds , fall upon their Tables and into their Meat , insomuch that they can hardly eat without taking down some of them ; in the Night when they repose themselves upon the ground , they cover it three or four Inches thick , and if a Wheel pass over them , they emit a stench hardly to be endured : All which , and much more may be fully seen in the French Description of the Countries of Poland , made by Monsieur de Beauplan , and by Monsieur Thevenot , in his Relation of the Cosacks , contained in the First part of his Curious Voyages .

My Reasons for giving the preference to the Husks of this Tribe , before the Flowers , are , because I commonly observe the Calyces are the chiefest , if not the only part on which I find it ' s Viscous or Sulphureous Particles to adhere , this you may very easily perceive , not only by it ' s much stronger and penetrating smell , but by the Clamminess of this , far beyond the other parts , as is very apparent , particularly in the Husks of Sage and Clary , and if with Spirit of Wine you make a Distillation of these alone , you will find them much stronger then from a greater quantity of Flowers only , which being of finer and more Volatile parts , are only capable of retaining what the vicinity of the stronger and thicker Texture , which the Calyces are composed of , and can without prejudice easily communicate to them .	I look upon the generality of this Tribe , to be a degree Warmer then the last , and their Heat consequently to approach nearer to the Aromatae or Spices , then the Carminatives , and the Effects therefore to be more peculiarly appropriated to such Nervous Diseases , as are more intense , and the Umbelliferae cannot so quicklyreach , Viz Apolexies , Epilepsies , Palsies , & amp ; c .

I wrapped the same piece of linen round the mouth of the dog , which had served for the former experiment , and seemed now not to feel any of its effects ; I wrapped it , I say , so as that he might breathe freely ; and while his master kept him lying down in the grotto , I held a sponge imbibed with vinegar to his nose .

This raising of Blood was accompanied with these circumstances ; it had increased every day , for 3 days before I saw her , she coughed and brought up a Viscous Phlegm , such as our Patients Vomit when their Stomachs are very foul ; only as mere Phelgm is white , this was all of it as red as Blood , it was not streaked with Blood , or had a mixture of white Phlegm with it , but was so deeply coloured , that it seemed to be all Blood , only it would not flow as Blood does whilst it is hot ; nor did it coagulate as Blood does when it is cold , but hung from the Basons when it was poured out , as Vomited Phlegm does ; and in this it differed from all the Bloody Expectorations I have seen , excepting Mr Jones at Mine Heer Meysters ' s in Kensington , who Coughed the same Bloody coloured Pituita , but in much less quantity , for Mrs Terry raised above a Pint in 24 hours , for some days , and tho a less yet a considerable quantity afterwards ; Mrs Terry ' s afforded a very strong smell , but Mr Jones ' s had no Odour .

At first she was under the care of another Physician , who told her Relations when they desired his judgment of the Disease , and its event , That it was an Ulcer in her Lungs , and he believed incurable , upon which they again committed her to my care .

I prescribed such Medicines , as abated that Purulent Expectoration several times , and she often gave me hopes of her Recovery , she continuing to have the Menses regularly , and being still free from an Hectic , but upon every little ~ ~ again raised that fetid Pus in a considerable ~ .	She generally continued pretty free from Coughing several hours together , till she perceived something of a ~ in her Breast , which would oblige her to Cough , and after she had once began to raise she could not cease , till she had brought up two Spoonfuls or more of that fetid Pus .

This she did chiefly in the Morning , Afternoon and at Night ; I did apprehend she had an abscess in the Left Lobe of her Lungs , and made her lye upon the Bed , with her head reaching to the Chamber Floor , leaning upon her Left Arm .

They saw her lye in the posture I have described , and saw more than 2 spoonfuls of stinking Pus or Corruption run out of her Mouth , after a little Coughing .	This made it so apparent that there was an Ulcer in her Lungs , that they immediately approved of what I had before proposed to her and her Relations , of the necessity of making an Apertition in her side , where we could apprehend the Lungs grew to it for that seemed unquestionable , from the posture of discharging it ; and some little pain she feit in her side .

The filtered and decanted liquids mixed together were boiled till the smell of nitrous acid ceased , and there remained about half an ounce of acid liquor , which being filtered to separate the vitriolated lime precipitated during evaporation , fossil alkali was added to perfectly saturate it .	During this union there was an effervescence and a separation of more vitriolated lime , which being removed , the saturated liquor , by crystallization , afforded nearly 26 grains of crystals of phosphorated fossil alkali , besides sides a little cubic nitre , vitriolated fossil alkali and iron , with some vestiges of calx of antimony , and phosphorated lime .

Whereupon he tried , whether he could combine them by digestion ; but that also not succeeding , he powred off the Oil ( which he found to retain almost its former scent and taste ) and powred upon the remaining Mucilage some Tartarised Spirit of Wine , of which by a short digestion it was resolved into a highly red Tincture .	By these two Experiments the Author thinks , he hath made it evident , of what value the hitherto neglected works ofDigestion are ; as also given a hint of the great efficacy there is in Volatil Salts , if they be fettered , and kept from avolation .

Then , to further the same , add four ounces of sugar very finely pulverised , and observe still such a degree of heat , as Fermentation requires ; which by so doing will duly proceed , and you shall see the Opium manifestly rise and dissolve per minima ; taking heed mean while of the strong ~ scented stupefying Sulphur , which then is wont to steam out .

Further , if perhaps the fire be excessive during the Distillation , much of the Volatil Salt will be burnt up , and it will yield a strong smelling Spirit .	Having dispatch ' t this , the Author subjoyns an account , he met with among his Papers , of another way of Operation of Grinding of Gold ; which though he have not yet tried , yet it seeming to him very likely to succeed , he scruples not to communicate also .

The liquor , when poured out of the tube , smelled evidently of phlogisticated nitrous acid , and being evaporated to dryness , yielded 1 4 / 10 gr .	of salt , which is pretty exactly equal in weight to the nitre which that quantity of soap - lees would have afforded if saturated with nitrous acid .
ro2893	smell								on		This solution , however , being deprived of some of its phlogiston by evaporation to dryness , and exposure for a few weeks to the air , lost the property of precipitating silver from its solution ; a proof that this property depended only on its phlogistication , and not on its having absorbed sea - salt from the retort , or by any other means .	Hence it is certain , that nitre , when much phlogisticated , is capable of making a precipitate with a solution of silver ; and therefore there is no reason to think , that the precipitate , which our salt occasioned with a solution of silver , proceeded from any other cause than that of its being phlogisticated ; especially as it appeared by the smell , both on first taking it out of the tube , and on the addition of the spirit of nitre , previous to dropping in the solution of silver , that the acid in it was much phlogisticated .	This property of phlogisticated nitre is worth the attention of chemists ; as otherwise they may sometimes be led into mistakes , in investigating the presence of marine acid by a solution of silver .

His Histories of the Interloping Diseases succeed , and the first of that kind is an Apoplexy ; when he has related the History of the Symptoms , and proved it as shortly as the clearing of the matter could allow of , he tells us , that no kind of Apoplexy is to be Cured , but that by the depression of the Skull , and the Blood stopping in the Carotid Arteries in the Brain ; and that all Methods of Cure in the Paroxysm , are ridiculous and useless , except Smells , and Blooding in the Jugular : This partial Blooding , or the Doctrine of Revulsion and Derivation , he demonstrates from the unequal Velocities of the Blood in time of Blooding , and before there was any Blood let ; and the Proportions he says are , as I to 1000 , or 1 to 1200 : This Doctrine , he says , the Ancients knew by Experience , but the Reason only depends upon Harvey ' s Circulation ; so that those who do not allow of such partial Blooding , seem not to understand the Doctrine of the Circulation .	After he has said this , he gives us the Method of Cure he took with that Patient .

The oil was in the state in which it is sold by the Indians ; it possessed the appearance of a semifluid butyraceous mass , evolving a peculiar penetrating odour ; its melting - point was 55 ? C .	To obtain the acids , the oil was saponified with a solution of potassic hydrate , and the soap thus obtained dissolved in a large quantity of distilled water ; to the solution sodic chloride was added in considerable excess ; the soap which separated was washed and afterwards dissolved , and the solution treated with hydrochloric acid ; the liberated fatty acids were collected and pressed , then melted in boiling water , and frequently washed to remove all traces of sodic chloride ; the acids were again saponified , and again treated with sodic chloride , but the soda - soap was on this occasion decomposed with tartaric acid .

As to the second ; the Nervus Olfactorius , after it has passed the Ethmoides , does not at all communicate with these Laminae , but penetrates the Os Vomeris , whence the cartilaginous Septum of the Proboscis arises : So that these Cellules can be no ways assisting for that end , the Sensation of Smelling being chiefly performed in the Proboscis , and not by the Fibres of the Nervus Olfactorius dispersed in these Laminae , which are quite otherwise disposed here , than in Men , Dogs , & amp ; c .	whose Laminae Spongiosae are situated in the Root of the Nose ; so that the Air must touch them before it reach the Os Cribrosum ; whereas here the Laminae are so situated , that the Air touches the Nervus Olfactorius as soon as it can touch them .

In most of other Animals , neither is this anterior Production of the Brain so great , the Perforations of the Os Cri ' orosum so many , nor its extent so large : But in Animals of an acute Smelling , besides the Perforations of the Os Cribrosum , there are several spongious Laminae which arise from its lower part ; each whereof are endued with Tunicles , wherein are variously dispersed several Branches of the Nervus Olfactorius ; and these Laminae are set very near to one another , as it were the Teeth in a Comb , or the Lamellae in the lower Part of some Mushromes .	Both the Contrivance of the Laminae and their thick disposal , are very useful for Sensation ; for whereas , had ~ this ~ Nervus Olfactorius been still in one Trunk , the Volatile Saline Particles ~ would have only acted upon such Filaments as compose the Surface ; whereas the Nerve being variously dispersed into divers Branches , and these Branches differently disposed into several Surfaces , it is capable to receive impression from as many Saline Particles , as there are different Branches and Surfaces , whereinto , these are disposed : Add also , that the sharp Edges of these Laminae being toward the Air , they are more capable to divide the Columnae Aeris sucked in by the Nose , and give a greater tension to the Nervous Filaments dispersed in them ; whereby the Sensation is communicated the more lively to the Sensorium Commune ; Os Ethmoides .
ro2984	Smelling	such Creatures|most of|their	the more acute								Both the Contrivance of the Laminae and their thick disposal , are very useful for Sensation ; for whereas , had ~ this ~ Nervus Olfactorius been still in one Trunk , the Volatile Saline Particles ~ would have only acted upon such Filaments as compose the Surface ; whereas the Nerve being variously dispersed into divers Branches , and these Branches differently disposed into several Surfaces , it is capable to receive impression from as many Saline Particles , as there are different Branches and Surfaces , whereinto , these are disposed : Add also , that the sharp Edges of these Laminae being toward the Air , they are more capable to divide the Columnae Aeris sucked in by the Nose , and give a greater tension to the Nervous Filaments dispersed in them ; whereby the Sensation is communicated the more lively to the Sensorium Commune ; Os Ethmoides .	~ and it is observable , that such Creatures as have most of these Laminae have their Smelling the more acute .	Now this Structure is only to be seen in those Animals , whose Septum intermedium and two sides of the Nose consist of Bones , at least so far as their Laminae are extended ; but it fares otherwise with our Elephant , whose Os Ethmoides is very thin , and has no Laminae Spongiosae adhering to its outside , nor a Bone for the Septum , or Sides to guard these Laminae , which would have been inconvenient , for then the Proboscis could not have moved with the same Facility , e ' en from its Root , as it doth .
ro2984	Smelling		so acute								Now this Structure is only to be seen in those Animals , whose Septum intermedium and two sides of the Nose consist of Bones , at least so far as their Laminae are extended ; but it fares otherwise with our Elephant , whose Os Ethmoides is very thin , and has no Laminae Spongiosae adhering to its outside , nor a Bone for the Septum , or Sides to guard these Laminae , which would have been inconvenient , for then the Proboscis could not have moved with the same Facility , e ' en from its Root , as it doth .	Therefore to supply this defect , and still to continue the Smelling so acute , if not more in this than in many other Animals , it is provided , that the anterior Fossa should be very deep , that the Production of the Brain in it might be the greater ; and lest its Surface should still be too small , there should be eminent Lines both in the Vomer and throughout the rest of the Bone , that there might still be more space for branching out the Nerve , as it proceeds from its Origin .	There may also be another Reason alleged for these protuberances , viz .
ro2984	Smelling|Smelling|odoriferous|odoriferous	Nervus Olfactorius	odoriferous|odoriferous				Creature				There may also be another Reason alleged for these protuberances , viz .	because the Brain is more pendent here than elsewhere , they may serve as so many Columns to support it , lest by its Weight it should lean too much upon the Os Cribrosum , so that the Origin of the Nervus Olfactorius being too much pressed , instead of a clear , might afford a very confused Idea of Smelling ; and , that even within the Scull it may be so divided and dispersed in this Animal , as it uses to be without it in others : So that the defect of the Laminae Spongios ~ without , is ~ by this diversity of Perforations and Eminences in the Os Cribrosum within Indeed in Horses there is somewhat of this Structure to be ~ The Os Cribrosum seems to be proportionally as large ; its Perforations as frequent ; and the Laminae Spongiosae without , both - few and thin set ; by which that Creature has but an ordinary Sensation of Smelling , and only such as is convenient for the choice of its Food ; because the Nervus Olfactorius has not such a space wherein to be dispersed , as the Septum and Cartilaginous Sides of the Proboscis ; which is so great , that scarce can a Particle of any odoriferous Substance escape the touching of some one or other of the Nervous Filaments : Whereas in Horses , there being but a short space betwixt the Os Cribrosum and the Nose , the additional Surfaces of the Laminae Spongiosae , and the tension of the Bone of the Nose on both sides , otherwise than in the Elephant , who has no Bone there at all , are very convenient to supply that defect ; for you know the more extended a Nerve is , the greater is its Sensation , and a Bone is fitter for tension than either a Cartilage or other soft Substances are .

ro2987	smell	caseine|rubian|the						for sevetal days			It appears , therefore , that the action of albumen on rubian is but slight .	In order to ascertain what effect caseine has on rubian , I mixed a solution of the latter with a quantity of milk , and allowed the mixture to stand in a warm place for sevetal days , until the smell indicated that the caseine had entered into a state of putrefaction .	The liquid , which was still yellow and bitter , was filtered from the caseine , which had separated in yellow flocculent masses , and basic acetate of lead was added , which produced a red precipitate .
ro2987	smell	the mixture	putrid						after standing for several weeks		A similar negative result was obtained with gelatine and yeast .	A solution of rubian being mixed with a - solution of glue , the mixture after standing for several weeks began to emnit a putrid smell , and acquired a reddish tinge , but remained bitter , and deposited nothing insoluble .	On adding yeast to a solution of rubian , and allowing to stand until putrefaction commenced , no apparent change took place in the solution , which retained its yellow colour and bitter taste .
ro2987	smell		putrid								This produced a gray precipitate , which was collected on a filter and well washed with cold alcohol .	Some of this precipitate was then added to a solution of rubian , and the mixture was allowed to stand in a moderately warm place until it began to disengage a putrid smell .	The liquid was then filtered , and evaporated to dryness .

If erythrozym be mixed with water , and the mixture be allowed to stand for a length of time in a warm place , signs of a more active process of fermentation begin to show themselves , especially in summer weather ; bubbles of gas are given off , and putrid .	During this process , which is evidently one of putrefaction in the stricter sense , the erythrozym loses its sliminess , and is converted into a red flocculent mass , which may easily be separated by filtration from the liquid .

The last specimen I examined was one which was prepared in the usual manner by precipitation with alcohol , then mixed with water and allowed to decompose until bubbles of gas began to be disengaged , and the smell peculiar to this substance when in a state of putrefaction began to be emitted , then treated with boiling alcohol until nothing more was dissolved , and dried .	grm .

From all these various Accounts , there was no sulphureous Smell , or Eruption ; no Fissures in the Ground perceived : Yet several People were sick up on it ; infinite Numbers terribly affrighted ; and as soon forgot the Impression of it , or talked of it in a merry Strain , as commonly with us at London .	So little are the Vulgar affected , without something very sensible , and so soon is the Sense of it worn out ! It was more evidently perceived by People standing ; most , by those that were sitting ; least , by such as were walking ; and in upper Stories of Houses more than in lower , or in Cellars .
ro3015	Smells		sulphureous							Eruptions|as to favour internal Convulsions of the Earth	We observe , the vulgar Solution of subterraneous Eruptions receives no Countenance from all that was seen or felt during these Earthquakes : It would be very hard to imagine how any such thing could so suddenly and instantaneously operate thro ' this vast Space , and that in so similar and tender a manner , over the Whole , thro ' so great a Variety as well as Extent of Country , as to do no Mischief .	A philosophical Inquirer in Northamptonshire , who had his Eye particularly on this Point , takes notice there were not any Fissures in the Ground , any sulphureous Smells , or Eruptions , any - where perceived , so as to favour internal Convulsions of the Earth ; yet we learn , from a Letter , at Uppingham in Rutland , that a Plaister Floor became cracked thereby .	These kind of Floors are frequent in this Country ; what we call Stucco in London ; and it gives us a good Notion of the undulatory Vibration produced by an Earthquake ; which some have compared to that of a musical String ; others , to that of a Dog , or a Horse , shaking themselves when they come out of the Water .

This mode also makes the conveyance of the water very uncertain , for the passage is not unfrequently choaked ; and the pumps ( from its not being practicable to continue them sufficiently down ) always leave from ' 6 to 8 inches of water in the ship ; so that these compartments constantly contain a certain quantity of putrid bilge water , offesive and injurious to the heait of those on board .	186 The deficiency of strength causes also an alarming insecurity in the plank of the bottom , as shown at E , PI .
ro3038	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid	water							Water courses , as shown by dotted lines at N , are to be lIft in the joints of the timber under the plank , for the purpose of conveying the water to the pumps ; which , by this plan , will reach below the water , instead of being some inches above , as is the case with the present mode , before described ; consequently , by .	the proposed system , no stagnant water will remain ; and farther , the limber passage , or water course , will be one smooth , uniform channel , which can be cleared with ease , should it be required , whenever the hold is unstowed ; whereas at present it is inaccessible in places , and forms compartments for putrid water , without there being any means of removing it .	It is obvious , that a ship on the principle I have here - recommended , may sustain the loss of certain planks of the bottom , and also the keel , ( which has frequently been found to have happened to ships of war on their being taken into dock ) and still reach the place of her destination ; when the loss of either , would be the destruction of aship built on the present mode .

By washing with water , drying over caustic potash , and rectification over sodium , pure ethyl - amyl was obtained as a light mobile liquid possessing a faint ethereal odour which cannot be distinguished from that of hydride of heptyl .	It boils at 90 ? - 910 C .

The aqueous distillate , in which some drops of an oily liquid were suspended , had the odour of aniline , and gave with a solution of bleaching - powder the most distinct aniline - reaction .

These observations , as well as the unpleasant odour which all the compounds derived from the hydrocarbons from petroleum possess , prove that they contain impurities which will certainly tend to raise the specific gravities .	Moreover , Dale has shown that the hydrocarbons obtained from the acids of the series C , H11 _ 2 04 also have a much lower specific gravity than the corresponding petroleum hydrocarbons .

I myself received the shock so suddenly as not to remember I either heard the thunder or saw the lightning : the first thing that I can recollect with any degree of certainty is , that I found myself in the vicarage seat , which is very near the desk , without either gown or surplice , bearing in my arms as I then thought a dead sister , and God knows it was a miracle that she was not so ; I perceived a very strong sulphureous smell , almost suffocating , and a great heat .	At this time the confusion among the congregation was inconceivable , some running out of the church for safety , and returning into it again ( for the stones from the roof were falling on our heads , both in and out of the church ) ; some on their knees , imploring the divine assistance , giving themselves up to certain destruction ; and a great many , in different places of the church , lying quite motionless , whom I thought then to be quite dead .
ro3065	smell	of volatile alkali	strong				I		by super - phlogisticating iron with nitrous air		In alkaline air lead seems to be formed from the minium as readily as in inflammable air , and indeed I thought rather more so ; and this is a remarkable confirmation and illustration of these experiments , in which , by taking the electric spark in a quantity of alkaline air , I converted it into three times as much pure inflammable air ; an experiment which , on account of the extraordinary nature of it , I have repeated many times since I first published the account of it , and always with the same result .	This experiment also throws some light upon those in which , by super - phlogisticating iron with nitrous air , I produced a strong smell of volatile alkali ; an experiment which I have also frequently repeated with the same result .	The reviving of lead in alkaline air may also help us to conceive how all acids should have an affinity both to phlogiston and to alkalies , which have hitherto appeared to be things so very different from each other ; since , from these experiments , it is probable that one of them is some modification of the other , or a combination of something else with the other .

In this case , however , much of the inflammable air went to the formation of the vitriolic acid air , the smell of which was very perceivable in the course of the experiment .	The copper that I made in this way was brittle , and therefore seemed not to be perfectly metalized ; but being fuzed with borax it became perfect copper , and , as I think , without any loss of weight .
ro3065	smell	of phosphorus	strong								Thus , by means of it , I was able to make phosphorus , nitrous air , liver of sulphur , and sulphur itself , in all of which phlogiston is acknowledged to be a principal ingredient .	Throwing the focus of the lens upon a quantity of that glassy matter which is made from calcined bones by oil of vitriol in inflammable air , some of it was absorbed , and all the inside of the receiver was covered with an orange - coloured substance , which had a strong smell of phosphorus .	I then wanted sun - shine to continue the experiment ; but I was satisfied that there was sufficient proof of phosphorus being actually formed in this manner .
ro3065	fumes|fumes		white	fumes|fumes				during			With alkaline air I succeeded much better .	In 21 / 2 ounce measures of this air I produced , from the glassy matter mentioned above , 2 grains of phosphorus in one mass , the vessel being only filled with white fumes during the process .	Fresh nitrous air , made in the usual way , and mixed with common air in the same proportion , occupied the space of 1 , 26 .

Lastly , to produce sulphur , I threw the focus of the lens on a quantity of oil of vitriol , contained in an hollow earthen vessel , and evaporated it to dryness in a receiver filled with inflammable air , in consequence of which the inside of the receiver acquired a whitish incrustation , which when warmed had a strong smell of sulphur ; and repeating the process in the same receiver , I was able , this second time , to scrape off enough of the matter to put on a piece of hot iron , and to produce the genuine blue flame , as well as the peculiar smell of sulphur .	I shall conclude these observations on phlogiston with two articles ; one of which seems to contradict an established maxim among chemists ; and the other a former opinion of my own .
ro3065	smell	Spirit of wine|it									I had no doubt , therefore , but that all the water within the retort would have got through into the receiver .	Spirit of wine , or something that had the smell of it , was transmitted from the clay through the retort in the same manner .	I then filled the receiver with inflammable air , and upon heating the retort it was all drawn through it , and delivered as strongly inflammable as ever by the tube communicating with the inside of it , while the water rose within the receiver , and even covered the retort , which was fixed at the very top of it , so that hardly any of the inflammable air remained within it .

In that communication I stated that a young Terrier , whose parents had been much employed in destroying Polecats , and a young Springing Spaniel , whose ancestry through many generations had been employed in finding Woodcocks , were reared together as companions , the Terrier not having been permitted to see a Polecat , or any other animal of similar character , and the Spaniel having been prevented seeing a Woodcock , or other kind of game ; and that the Terrier evinced , as soon as it perceived the scent of the Polecat , very violent anger ; and as soon as it saw the Polecat attacked it with the same degree of fury as its parents would have done .	The young Spaniel , on the contrary , looked on with indifference but it pursued the first Woodcock which it ever saw with joy and exultation , of which its companion , the Terrier , did not in any degree partake .

Here again , with some timorousness , I propose the Inquiry , whether Subterraneous steames might not give the dark yellow tincture to the Hamden Quarre , and the property to this water of Rusty well for the fulvous coloration : It cannot be expected , that Materials , differing so much as stones seem to differ from water , when perfectly petrifyed , thould retain the very same Colour , though both received it from the very same Steames .

The same I propose for the blackness and faetidness of the Spring in West - Camel , and of the Cole near Wine - Caunton ; that both may receive the same tincture , and odour from Subterranean steames , which may perhaps be of so many kinds , and mixtures , as to cause much of the great diversities of Metals , Minerals , Earths , and Soils ; and of some minute differences in the Colour , Taste , Odour , and dress of Vegetables Yea and of the Furs , Hairs , Wool , and other little varietyes in Animals ( particularly in sheep ) in several places ; more immediately in Vegetables , and of Animals by remoter circumstances , I will not except the Ethiopick hue , and humors of men in distant Climates ; though Vegetables and Animals do ( for the most part ) retain their seminal properties in distant Climates for many generations : and perhaps from these terrestrial steams the Vegetables do imperceptibly draw some of their Salts , and much of their nutriment .	These things I dare not affirm , nor say much more , till I see fit time and place to offer my reasons and other Observations .

An Hour after it was dead I opened it , and found all the Contents of the Abdomen well ; the Stomach was distended with Wind , being opened , it appeared empty of Milk , but full of Froth , and a clear Mucus of a much thicker Consistence than the Liquor Gastricus naturally is ; they had no Smell at all , the inside of the Stomach was not at all inflamed .

It has the following characters ; It is of a pale lemon yellow colour ; it has no smell ; it is decomposed by a gentle heat , or by exposure to a strong light ; prussic acid is then formed , and white triple prussiate of iron , which quickly absorbing oxygen from the air , changes to blue triple prussiate .	It forms directly with alkalies , earths , or oxides , the salts termed triple prussiates .

The odour of the last four of these resins is very similar , though that of assafoetida is the most powerful and disagreeable .	We might anticipate , therefore , some resemblance in constitution among these resins , since they exhibit in common this very striking property .

A quantity of water and of a volatile oil , having the odour of benzoin , is always ( ? ) given off along with the acid , even when the operation is conducted in the most careful manner .	There are several circumstances which , though perhaps not decisive on the point , yet induce me to doubt whether the acid really exists ready formed , in any quantity at least , in the natural resin .
ro3283	fragrant|fragrant	resins	fragrant|fragrant								In future papers , I hope to be able to place the question in a more satisfactory point of view , by the aid of other experimental researches , which I shall then have had an opportunity of bringing before the Society .	In favour of the view of the constitution of the fragrant resins * above preferred , I would direct attention to the researches of FREMY , into the constitution of the balsams of Peru and Tolut , in which he has detected an oily liquid ( cinnameine = C54 H21 Os ) , convertible by the action of caustic potash into cinnamic acid = C18 H8 04 , and by chlorine , among other products , into chloride of benzyle , which water , as is well known , converts into benzoic acid .	This action of potash on cinnameine he compares to that of the same base on oleine ; and he considers it highly probable that the resin of benzoin , while in the balsamic state , contains an oily fluid , which by potash is convertible into benzoic acid .
ro3303	fetid|fetid	matter	fetid|fetid						when irritated		2Q8 The portion of the intestine below the orifice of the hepatic duct , as it may be called , appears to be externally traversed in a longitudinal direction by several rows of small convex eminences resembling beads ; these are the outer surfaces of so many corresponding internal sinuses , which are probably formed as the similar sinuses in the large intestines of man , and many other animals , by a pecularity in the disposition of the fibres of the muscular coat .	Near the termination of the intestine are two orifices , one on each side , communicating each with a duct which soon swells out into a vesicular bag ; these bags may probably be glands that secrete the fetid matter which the insect ejects from the anus when irritated .	In one instance I found , on the site of the orifices above - mentioned , two small bodies about the size of a pin ' s head , of a dark colour , and to the naked eye of a spherical form ; my surprise was considerable when upon observing them with a magnifying lens , I perceived that they exactly resembled a crystallized rosette of brown pearl - spar .

The water in the globe appeared to have lost something of its transparency , and had changed its colour to a very faint greenish cast , having at the same time acquired the odour or fragrance proper to raw silk .	This experiment I repeated several times with fresh water ( retaining the same silk ) and always with nearly the same result ; with this difference , however , that when the sun shone very bright , the quantity of air produced was not only greater , but its quality likewise was much superior to that yielded when the sun ' s rays were more feeble , or when they were frequently intercepted by flying clouds .

Phosphoric spar is easily known by the luminous appearance it has when heated , and also by the smell it affords when added to oil of vitriol made hot , which exactly resembles that of acid of salt .	It is found of various colours , as green , blue , purple , crimson , white , and also yellow .

I have made trials of the powder of the root in the same doses , in which the foreign rhubarb is given , and found no difference in its effects ; its operation being equally easy and powerful .

We further observe a difference betwixt those Seeds that have only a fragrant smell and a pungent taste alone , from those that have both Odorous Emanations and a brisk Taste together , and those that are insipid , and have no smart Taste .	In the first place we must set aside those Oils made by Expression .

In so much that we may safely conclude that by this Powerful Mixture a third Solid Body results absolutely differing from either of the two mentioned Liquors : And which makes it the more Remarkable , that both of these Fluids , which have so great an impression upon the Organs of Smell , and a very great one on the Organs of Taste , should in an instant be destroyed , and terminate in a dry insipid Caput Mortuum , which will not melt in the Air , nor be dissolved by Water , nor other Corrosive Menstruums , but remains as much a Caput Mortuum , as a piece of Paper , or a Rag burnt to Ashes , if not much more .	Upon a review of the whole , this Experiment will possibly not only surprise and amuse some , but please and delight others ; and not only so , but perhaps afford some Instruction to a Philosophical Genius .

He was Master of a Copperas Work at Whistable in Kent , and engrossed all the Pyrites or Copperas - stone to himself , in order to the breaking of a Neighbours Work , in so much that he had laid up two or three Hundred Tun in a heap , and built a Shed over it to keep off the Rain : But in the space of six or seven Months it first smoaked , and then took fire , and burnt for a Week ; it burnt down the Shed , some of it looked like melted Metal , and other parts like red - hot Stones , but discharged so faetid , Sulphurous , or stinking Exhalations , that the People in the Neighbourhood were miserably afflicted , and forced to use all their endeavours to extinguish it .	How far this Communication will serve the Hypotheses of those that derive Lightning , and Thunder , and Earthquakes from the Matter of the Pyrites , or will Account for the Rise or Continuance of burning Vulcans , or even the Great Conflagration of the World , I leave to their Consideration .

ro3389	odour	gland	strong musky								I make no apology therefore for the following short communication , to which the foregoing observations are , to a certain extent , applicable .	It has long been known , that beneath the lower jaw of the alligator and crocodile , there is situated , on each side , a gland , the office of which is to secrete an unctuous substance , having a strong musky odour : but although anatomists have not been ignorant of the existence of such a gland , our infor .	mation has hitherto rested here , whilst its structure , and the apparatus connected with it , appear not to have been investigated , nor has any probable object of such a formation been suggested .
ro3389	odour		powerful		exactly resembling that of musk						The scales with which it is immediately surrounded are much smaller than those which cover the neighbouring parts ; and it is generally concealed by a duplicature of the integuments , so that the skin requires to be extended laterally before it can be brought into view .	Through this opening exudes an unctuous substance of a consistence somewhat like suet , of a brownish colour , and with a powerful odour exactly resembling that of musk .	Having kept two of these animals for several months , I made occasional observations on this secretion , and found , as might have been expected , that during the warm weather , while they fed freely , and when all their functions were more perfectly developed , I could at any time procure it by slightly pressing the gland with the finger ; but that in the winter , notwithstanding they were almost constantly kept in a room with a fire , and daily placed in warm water , it was greatly diminished in quantity , and its odour much less powerful .

Having kept two of these animals for several months , I made occasional observations on this secretion , and found , as might have been expected , that during the warm weather , while they fed freely , and when all their functions were more perfectly developed , I could at any time procure it by slightly pressing the gland with the finger ; but that in the winter , notwithstanding they were almost constantly kept in a room with a fire , and daily placed in warm water , it was greatly diminished in quantity , and its odour much less powerful .	On removing the integuments , the gland itself is seen closely attached to the skin , and lying between it and the under surface of the tongue .
ro3389	odoriferous|odoriferous	glands	odoriferous|odoriferous			in various tribes of animals					It is obvious that the oblique position of the gland in a state of rest must prevent , or at least greatly impede the free passage of the secretion from the interior ; but the longitudinal contraction of the muscle would tend to draw the base of the gland backwards and inwards , and having thus brought its axis in a direct line with the opening , would facilitate the exit of the musk ; whilst , by the action of the fibres which surround the fundus of the gland , that organ would itself be compressed , and the secretion forced through the opening at the will of the animal .	When the situation of this gland is compared with that of other odoriferous glands occurring in various tribes of animals , so remarkable a discrepancy in this respect necessarily the strikes us as indicative of some peculiar object to be attained by it .	The secre ' ion of powerful odours is generally confined , in other animals , to the neighbourhood of the generative organs ; and we find glands of this description on each side the cloaca , even in the animal now under consideration .

These facts strikingly coincide with the mode in which the alligators take their prey , as far as the observations I had an opportunity of making on those in my possession enable me to judge .

These little Lumps have neither Taste nor Smell , and are friable , so as to be easily reduced to a very subtle Powder .	It has some Parts , which are strongly attracted by the Loadstone ; and others so very inactive , as scarcely to seem to be magnetical : the strongest are the blackest ; but the inactive ones are more shining , and more inclining to the Colour of Lead ; these are in the greatest Quantity , and from them the others are got out by a Loadstone .

One of them was about an Inch long , and as big as a Goose ~ , but Taper towards the end , and from the colour of the Liquor it contained , appeared darkish ; the other Bag was something less , and it ' s colour colour as in the Viper , This difference I supp se may be accidental : The Liquor included in them was something crass , and of a strong and very unpleasant Smell ; such , but in a more intense degree , as the Animal did emitt before dissection , which d Martial likewise takes notice off , having placed it in the last but one in his Catalogue of Stinks , where he saith Quod Vulpis fuga , Viperae cubile , Malles , quam quod oles , olere Bassa .

ro3415	odour	of human faeces									The results obtained from the study of the nature and composition of healthy human evacuations , together with the method of investigation employed , have been condensed into a synoptic table annexed to the present communication .	It is superfluous to dwell upon the odour , colour and consistence of human faeces ; their reaction is constantly alkaline , and they yield but a very weak extract to distilled water .	This alkaline reaction is common to the castings of every animal , and is very probably owing to the presence of ammoniaco - magnesian phospllates , the only strongly alkaline immediate principle which I have obtained from excrements , and which , being soluble , though sparingly , in hot water , is the cause of their alkaline nature .

When boiled in alcohol , human faeces yield an abundant extract , and if small quantities of alcohol be used at a time , and the extract rapidly filtered through a i ' ough , clean cloth , nothing remains on the filter but a brown mass , devoid of smell , insoluble in ether , and yielding to boiling water nothing but ammoniaco - magnesian phosphates , which can be obtained crystallized by slow evaporation .	It was found necessary to operate each time on the whole evacuation , which was treated with boiling alcohol of specific gravity 845 : upwards of fifty human evacuations were examined , about a pint and a half of alcohol being required for each operation ; the faeces were previously mixed with a little water , to facilitate the action of the alcohol when their consistence was too solid .
ro3415	smell	This alcoholic extract|of the matter	very distinct								It was found necessary to operate each time on the whole evacuation , which was treated with boiling alcohol of specific gravity 845 : upwards of fifty human evacuations were examined , about a pint and a half of alcohol being required for each operation ; the faeces were previously mixed with a little water , to facilitate the action of the alcohol when their consistence was too solid .	This alcoholic extract had a very distinct smell of the matter examined , and a strong acid reaction , showing that one or more acid principles exist as constituents of human evacuations .	The alcoholic solution was set aside for twenty - four hours , when an abundant deposit was found at the bottom of the beaker ; the fluid was decanted , and the deposit collected upon a filter .
ro3415	smell	the crystals	peculiar aromatic						When heated upon a platina knife		When treated with water containing any of the mineral acids , no decomposition ensues , even if the fluid be evaporated nearly to dryness ; nothing is obtained but the above resinous mass , which again yields crystals of excretine when dissolved in ether ; excretine does not therefore apparently combine with mineral acids .	When heated upon a platina knife , the crystals first fuse , evolving a peculiar aromatic smell ; they afterwards burn with a slight flame , disappearing very rapidly , and leaving a brown stain , which , on the further application of heat , is completely removed , and no inorganic residue is left behind .	The fusing - point of excretine was constantly found to be between 95 ? and 96 ? Centigrade .
ro3415	smell	it|of burnt fat							When|if heated on a platina knife|burnt with a gentle flame		Small dark specks were mixed here and there with the crystals , but no globules of oil were perceptible , although the evaporation of the ether was nearly complete .	When pressed between folds of filtering - paper , the substance left an oily stain ; if heated on a platina knife , it immediately fused , and burnt with a gentle flame , evolving a smell of burnt fat .	No inorganic residue remained on the platina knife after incineration .
ro3415	smell|fumes|fumes	fumes|fumes	peculiar|thick						When heated upon a platina knife|with a flame		If exposed for some time to the air , suspended in water , or in a mixture of water and alcohol , their structure becomes indistinct .	When heated upon a platina knife they fuse , evolve a peculiar smell and thick fumes which burn with a flame , and a 271 dark stain is left on the previously polished platina ; this stain finally disappears , leaving no residue .	They were found to be capable of combining with hydrated oxide of lead , the compound being insoluble in etherThe salt of lead , previously washed with ether in order to remove the oleate of lead , should any be present , and then decomposed by sulphuric acid , yielded to the ether an acid solution , which , after being thoroughly washed with water in order to separate the free sulphuric acid , and then evaporated spontaneously , deposited a colourless crystalline substance .
ro3415	smell		foetid		peculiar to faeces						I have already alluded more than once to a precipitate or deposit occurring in the alcolholic extract of healthy human evacuations , which appears to be of a very com plex nature .	If the above alcoholic extract after having stood for twenty - four hours be decanted , and the precipitate collected at the bottom of the beaker thr own upon a filter , the deposit presents an olive - brown appearance , a strongly acid reaction , and the foetid smell peculiar to faeces .	When viewed under the microscope , it appears to consist principally of small oily globules , of a yellow - green colour , having a strong refracting power , and mixed sometimes with crystals - of excretine accompanied by a yellow amorphous deposit .
ro3415	smell	This substance	oily						when heated upon a platina knife|burns with a flame		After a few hours , it had assumed a gelatinous consistence ; if it was then boiled with alcohol in a capsule or a glass flask as long as it yielded anything to that fluid , and finally filtered through white calico , a substance was left behind , insoluble in boiling alcohol .	This substance , when heated upon a platina knife , first fuses , then burns with a flame evolving an oily smell , and leaves a residue of white ashes .	The alcoholic filtrate from the above substance , after having been allowed to stand for twenty - four hours , yielded a deposit which fell to the bottom of the beaker ; the whole was next thrown upon a filter , thoroughly washed with cold alcohol , and the washings together with the filtrate concentrated on the water - bath .
ro3415	smell				peculiar to fresh evacuations						The ethereal extract obtained from the above substance deposits by spontaneous evaporation a crystalline matter , which has not yet been obtained in sufficient quantity to admit of its being examined .	The clear cold alcoholic solution obtained from the olive - coloured acid deposit , or the filtrate from the substance just described , having been evaporated down on the water - bath , yielded a deep olive - coloured oil , quite fluid when warm , and emitting 274 the smell peculiar to fresh evacuations .	With the view of obtaining it pure , I first dissolve it in ether , in order to remove a solid granular substance of a light consistence , insoluble in ether and in cold alcohol , but dissolving readily in hot , and forming a solution which yields , when concentrated , a number of round globules .
ro3415	smell	of burnt meat							when heated upon the		With the view of obtaining it pure , I first dissolve it in ether , in order to remove a solid granular substance of a light consistence , insoluble in ether and in cold alcohol , but dissolving readily in hot , and forming a solution which yields , when concentrated , a number of round globules .	These when heated upon the platina knife , fuse , and then burn , evolving a smell of burnt meat , and leaving behind a residue difficult to incinerate ; but not having succeeded in obtaining this substance in a crystallized state , I cannot say more at present as to its properties .	The oil deprived of the above granular substance , and dissolved in ether , was mixed with alcohol , and subsequently lime - water was added ; the mixture was then heated upon the water - bath , until a heavy precipitate , consisting of a compound of this oil with lime , had been deposited .
ro3415	smell	it			that of excretine				When heated on a platina spatula		This substance , dried over sulphuric acid at the temperature of the atmosphere , is solid , but fuses invariably between 25 ? and 26 ? Centigrade , showing it to exist in a pure state .	When heated on a platina spatula , it first fuses , evolving a smell somewhat resembling that of excretine ; it next takes fire and burns with a bright flame , which disappears as soon as the platina foil is removed from the lamp ; a black stain remains , which , by further application of heat , is completely removed .	When boiled with a solution of caustic potash , the substance does not dissolve , but floats on the surface of the liquid .
ro3415	smell	of butyric acid	strong								The concentrated fluid allowed to stand for several days , yielded no crystals , but merely an amorphous residue .	By distilling it with water in a small retort , a few drops of sulphuric acid having previously been added , I obtained a colourless acid fluid , having a strong smell , resetmbling that of butyric acid , which I at first considered to be owing to the presence of that substance ; but on treating this fluid with lime or baryta , I failed to obtain any clystallized salt , showing that butyric acid was not present , and consequently it cannot be considered as a constituent of human evacuations .	The ialcoholic extract concentrated on the water - bath was also treated with ether ; the ethereal solution obtained , decanted and allowed to evaporate spontaneously , yielded on several occasions crystals of excretine .
ro3415	smell	Newly - passed Tiger ' s excrements	peculiar nauseous								Castings of the Tiger .	- Newly - passed Tiger ' s excrements , obtained from the Zoological Gardens in small lumps , were of a pale colour , had a peculiar nauseous smell , and an alkaline reaction .	Having previously been washed with a small quantity of water , they were boiled with alcohol , and yielded a pale - coloured alcoholic extract .
ro3415	smell	they	peculiar		of the tiger ' s den				When heated upon a platina knife|when allowed to cool		The crystalline mass , dried first upon bibulous paper and then under the air - pump , assumed the form of slightly brickcoloured translucent scales .	When heated upon a platina knife , they first fused , emitting the peculiar smell of the tiger ' s den , and when allowed to cool exhibited a yellow waxy appearance , reflecting light powerfully under the microscope , but without any crystalline structure .	They burnt with a bright flame , leaving traces of a white inorganic residue , probably from their not being quite pure , and hardly any black stain .
ro3415	smell	it							when burnt		I atn not disposed to consider the above substance , which appears to exist in the castings of all the carnivorous animals I have had an opportunity of examining , as identical with human excretine , which it resembles , however , in many of its properties .	It appears to differ from it , first , by the shape of its crystals ; secondly , by the smell it emits when burnt ; thirdly , by a much less degree of solubility in alcohol and ether .	The filtrate from the lime precipitate was concentrated upon the water - bath , when a whitish - pink sediment was deposited , which , when examined under the microscope , was found entirely composed of small round crystalline masses radiating from a centre .
ro3415	smell	of butyric acid	strong						The addition of sulphuric acid		This salt of lime was found to be soluble , though not very readily , in alcohol ; on adding a few drops of water to the solution it turned milky , and on cooling the whole mass instantly crystallized .	The addition of sulphuric acid immediately brought out a strong smell of butyric acid ; the salt obtained from this alcoholic extract was therefore evidently butyrate of lime .	It could not be the lactate , although its crystalline form is similar , as the lactate is exceedingly soluble in water , and can only be made to crystallize in a very concentrated solution , contrary to what took place with the substance obtained from the Tiger , which begins crystallizing long before the solution has attained a high degree of concentration .
ro3415	smell	of rancid butter	distinct		peculiar to butyric acid				When a drop of sulphuric acid was added to some|heat subsequently applied		Heated upon a platina knife , they burnt with a flame , and left an ashy residue composed of lime .	When a drop of sulphuric acid was added to some of the crystals dried on filtering - paper , and heat subsequently applied , a distinct smell of rancid butter , peculiar to butyric acid , was evolved , showing them to be butyrate of lime .	After some days , the solution of the salt in alcohol , previously filtered through animal charcoal to remove the colouring matter , yielded by spontaneous concentration a number of perfectly white globular masses of crystals about the size of a large pin ' s head , which , when dried upon filtering - paper , assumed a beautiful silky appearance .
ro3415	smell	They	peculiar foetid						when dried		- During a visit to the Zoological Gardens , I had an opportunity of obtaining from the crocodile ' s cage a small quantity of the fresh castings of this animal .	They had a peculiar foetid smell , and when dried could be easily pounded into a white powder , some of which , treated with nitric acid and ammonia , failed to denote the presence of uric acid .	The pounded mass , after having been converted into a paste with a few drops of distilled water , and then boiled with alcohol in a glass flask , was thrown upon a calico filter .
ro3415	smell	it	scarcely|perceptible						If heated		Priessed between folds of bibulous paper , it assumed a pure pearly aspect , very similar to that of margaric acid .	If heated , it fuses very readily , emitting scarcely any perceptible smell , burning with a slight blue flame , and leaving behind a black stain , which , by the further application of heat , completely disappeared , nothing remaining on the spatula .	From the preceding experiments , it appears probable that the substance I have just described is a pure constituent of the Elephant ' s castings .
ro3420	snuff			The air							The moment the air enters into the lamp , it comes in contact with the candle , and consequently , upon all occasions , a small portion only of the air can be exploded , instead of the whole contents of the lamp ; by these means several obvious advantages are secured .	The air passing in a brisk current from below upward , close by the candle , carries the snuff with it , so that the light is always clear and steady .	I may also remark that wherever a person can exist from a sufficiency of atmospheric air , this lamp will afford a safe and abundant light , from one candle only , for the space of five hours at least .
ro3440	faetor		particular								In about ten minutes it began to pant and hold out its tongue , which symptoms continued till the end of the experiment , without ever becoming more violent than they are usually observed in dogs after exercise in hot weather ; and the animal was so little affected during the whole time , as to show signs of pleasure whenever we approached the basket .	After the experiment had continued half an hour , when the thermometer had risen to 236 ~ , we opened the basket , and found the bottom of it very wet with saliva , but could perceive no particular faetor .	We then applied a thermometer between the thigh and flank of the animal ; in about a minute the quicksilver sunk down to 110 ~ : but the real heat of the body was certainly less than this , for we could neither keep the ball of the thermometer a sufficient time in proper contact , nor prevent the hair , which felt sensibly hotter than respect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be respect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be respect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be prrespect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be prorespect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be prespect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be pro - respect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be prorespect to this last it is remarkable , if the factsrespect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be prorespect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be respect to this last it is remarkable , if the facts be properly perly represented , that an intolerable stench arose from the dog ; and that an assistant dropped down senseless upon going into the stove .

To prove that there was no fallacy in the degree of heat shown by the thermometer , but that the air which we breathed was capable of producing all the well - known effects of such an heat on inanimate matter , we put some eggs and a beef - steak upon a tin frame , placed near the standard thermometer , and farther distant from the cockle than from the wall of the room .

ro3506	smell|smelling	the impurities	considerable	the air			our				A still more convenient way , however , of procuring phlogisticated air is by a mixture of iron filings and sulphur ; and , as far as I can perceive , the air procured this way is as completely phlogisticated as that prepared by liver of sulphur .	Where the impurities mixed with the air have any considerable smell , our sense of smelling may be able to discover them , though the quantity is vastly too small to phlogisticate the air in such a degree as to be perceived by the nitrous test , even though those impurities impart their phlogiston to the air very freely .	For instance , the great and instantaneous power of nitrous air in phlogisticating common air is well known ; and yet ten ounce measures of nitrous air , mixed with the air of a room upwards of twelve feet each way , is sufficient to communicate a strong smell to it , though its effect in phlogisticating the air must be utterly insensible to the nicest Eudiometer ; for that quantity of nitrous air is not more than the 140000th part of the air of the room , and therefore can hardly alter its test by more than ~ / 140000 or 1 / 47000th part ~ Liver of sulphur also phlogisticates the air very freely , and yet the air of a room will acquire a very strong smell from a quantity of it vastly too small to phlogisticate it in any sensible degree .

In like manner it is certain , that putrefying animal and vegetable substances , paint mixed with oil , and flowers , have a great tendency to phlogisticate the air ; and yet it has been found , that the air of an house of office , of a fresh painted room , and of a room in which such a number of flowers were kept as to be very disagreeable to many persons , was not sensibly more phlogisticated than common air .

There is no reason to suppose from these instances , either that these substances have not much tendency to phlogisticate the air , or that nitrous air is not a true test of its phlogistication , as both these points have been sufficiently proved by experiment ; it only shows , that our sense of smelling can , in many cases , perceive infinitely smaller alterations in the purity of the air than can be per3 ceived Fig .	4 .

Aqueous vapour has been subjected to a special examination , and the author finds it a common fact for the aqueous vapour contained in the atmosphere to exercise 60 times the absorption of the air itself .	In fact , the further he has pursued his attempts to obtain perfectly pure and dry air , the more has the air approached the character of a vacuum .

ro3581	smell	it	medicinal		resembling somewhat that of valerian						So often did this occur , that I could not even then help suspecting that their presence could scarcely be accidental ; however , no analysis of the blue colouring matter was at that time made , and the circumstance was in a fair way of being forgotten , until the recollection of it was renewed by another occurrence .	In June 1852 , a sample of urine freely exposed to the air in an open vessel , was observed after four or five days ' exposure gradually to change colour ; the pellicle or scum which had formed on the surface of the urine became at first slate - coloured , and at length deep blue , with here and there a rusty - red tint : the urine also underwent , at the same time , some remarkable changes , becoming thick and turbid , deep brown , greenish , bluish - green , and finally of a faded yellowish - green colour ; a considerable sediment was found at the bottom of the glass , this was deep brown , soft and deliquescent , intermixed with a little blue colouring matter , and it had a medicinal smell resembling somewhat that of valerian .	In this state , without undergoing any further material changes , the urine remnained for many days .

It was tur : bid from the presence of a large quantity of triple phosphate , as also from the colouring matter ; 2 Q2 299 these quickly subsided and left a clear supernatant liquid of a deep wine - red colour ; above the deposit of earthy phosphates , collected at the bottom of the vessel , the colouring matter formed a thin stratum composed of dirty bluish - green flocculi .

I have already referred to the peculiar smell of valerian emitted by the extractive of more than one of the samples .

I have already referred to the peculiar smell of valerian emitted by the extractive of more than one of the samples .	We have thus then obtained tolerably conclusive evidence that the blue colouring matter in this case was indigo .

ro3581	odour	Cyanourine									Prussian blue may of course be readily distinguished from indigo , and it would 2R2 307 appear that the tests , as laid down in books , for cyanourine are scarcely less distinctive .	Cyanourine is described as a dark blue powder , destitute either of taste or odour ; it is scarcely soluble in water , moderately so in boiling alcohol ( the solution being blue ) , but it is deposited on cooling .	It is dissolved by dilute acids , the solution being brown or red , according to the quantity of acid .

C .	Bromiinated bromide of ethyl is a heavy aromatic oil , boiling at 1100 C .	, and consequently differing altogether from dibromide of ethylene , which boils at 130 ? C .
ro3583	odourless|odourless	liquid	extremely caustic|nearly odourless|odourless								If the alcoholic solution of the crude dibromide be used in this experiment , the first portions of oxide of silver added to the liquid are completely dissolved , and the solution , which has already become alkaline , deposits a white crystallized double compound of the dibromide with bromide of silver , which , however , is completely decomposed by further addition of oxide of silver and dilution with water .	In this manner there is produced an extremely caustic , nearly odourless liquid , having a strongly alkaline taste , and exhibiting the same bitterness which is so often observed in the analogous bodies of the nitrogen - series .	In other respects , the base exhibits the properties which characterize the hydrates of tetrethylphosphonium * and tetrethylammoniumt .
ro3603	smell	their	spiritous|stimulating								This I find justified in our Volatile Salt of Amber erroneously so called , for it does not come up to our standard of Volatility , and is really no Volatile Salt , as will be made appear : If you take this supposed Volatile Salt and Distil it in a Retort , or Head , and Body , with common Water , the Water will ascend in such a degree of Fire where the Salt will not , for you must increase your Fire considerably to make it rise after the Water is gone , and has left the dry Salt at the bottom .	This made me enquire farther into the properties of this Salt , which did not at all Correspond with Volatile Salts ( for all true Volatile Salts are Alkalies ) but on the contrary would ferment with them , and quite destroy the property of true Volatile Salts , by bringing them to a dull insipid Salt , which some call Sal Neutrum ; and also by fixing their Volatile Nature , not only in putting them by the standard of Volatility , but also does quite destroy their spiritous and stimulating smell , by virtue of which they have been always deservedly esteemed such excellent Cephalic Medicines .	Therefore examining this Salt yet a little farther , you will plainly prove it to be an Acid , that Corrodes Iron , turns Syrup of Julyflowers Green , destroys the Tincture of Lignum Nephriticum , and does not ferment with common Acids ; so that it plainly belongs to the Tribe of Acids , and should be struck out of the Catalogue of Volatile Salts ; and perhaps out of the number of Specific Cephalicks , and rather be degraded amongst the Diureticks , and even in that rank to have but an inferior station ; for it seems to me to be but a dull Medicine , and more Valuable for its Price than great Virtue , especially if quite divested of all its Oil , in which the great Cephalic and Cordial Virtue must needs be owned to consist .

And a little after he adds - - - - - - If the unstopt Viol were placed in our Vacuum , it would not emit any visible Steams at all , nor so much as appear in the upper part of the Glass its self that held the Liquor ; whereas when the Air was by degrees restored at the stop - cock , the returning Air would presently raise the Fumes first into the vacant part of the Viol , whence they would ascend into the Capacity of the Receiver ; and likewise when the Air that was requisite to support them was Pumped out , they also accompanied it as their unpleasant smell evinced , and the red Spirit , tho ' it remained unstopped , emitted no more fumes , till the new Air was let in again ; so far He .	Such you see was the proportion between the gravity of the Vapours of this red Liquor and the Air , that the Air being in its ordinary degree of gravity these Vapours did ascend ; but the Air ' s gravity being much lessened in the Receiver by the Pumping out a great deal of it , and so expanding the springs of the rest , it was not able to elevate those Vapours .

ro3654	smell	of Senna									He added one thing , which tho more particular , yet seemed more probable , which was , that the Leaves infused with Senna took from it , its disagreeable taste and smell without altering any thing of its Purgative quality .	The Samples that he sent were not in sufficient quantity to make experiment on the Distempers , he said , it was proper for ; but there was enough to try whether they had the virtue to correct the taste and smell of Senna .	Therefore there was infused two Dracmes of it with as much Senna in a Chopine of Water , and the experiment confirmed the matter of fact , being desirous to know what Species of Plant it was , and it being impossible to discover it by the Leaves the Portuguese Surgeon had taken so much care to cut thin very small .
ro3654	smell	ofSenna									To be the more certain of it , there was some of our Scrophularia sowed on a Bed , and some of the other seed on another , and there was observed but some small differences , which may be well attributed to the different Culture and Soil .	There was likewise tried the Virtue of our Scrophularia , and it was found to have the same effect , in taking away the taste and smell ofSenna .	Monsieur Marchand concluded from this discovery , that it was more fit to labour to know the Remedies that are in our own Land , than to run over all the Earth in quest of that , with much labour and charge , which we may have for nothing at home , if we took the pains to search .

When sparteine is boiled for a considerable time with an excess of strong hydrochloric acid , it seems also to be partially decomposed , as it acquires an odour resembling that of mice .	When a few drops of bromine are poured upon a little sparteine much heat is produced , and the sparteine is changed into a brownish resin .

They use also some sort of the Apocynum ' s ; particularly that which I think Gerard calls Vincetoxicum Americanum ; for there are several sorts of Apocynum ' s , I think 13 or 14 , but they are not all purgative : For having got some of the Root from an Indian , which he assured me was the Rattlesnake - root , I thought the Root of an Apocynum ( which may well be distinguished by that of Rosae Mariae foliis ) was very like it , both in Shape and Taste , considering the one dried , and the other fresh : Wherefore I got some Quantity thereof , and carrying it in my Pocket , I ventured to eat thereof , little by little , till I believe I have taken a Drachm at a time , to observe if it had any peculiar Operation on the Body ; but could never find , that it had .

It is mostly called by those who know it in Virginia , by the Name of Angelica : But showing a Piece of the Root to a great Woodsman , to see whether he knew it , and could tell me where it grew , he seemed surprised to see me have thereof ; and told me , that he kept an Indian once for some Weeks with him , because he was an excellent Woodsman , and going a hunting , ( i .

The Truth of this Story I no further assert , than that I was told it by a Person of seeming Seriousness , who had no Inducement to tell a Lye , or impose upon me : But I have often taken Notice , that the Indians smell generally strong of this Herb .	And I have since learned from others , that the Indians call it the Hunting - root , which makes me more inclinable to give Credence to this Story .

In the Night I was waked by a Rat , which ran over my Face , whereas I never at any other time had the like happen to me ; but will not be positive to conclude , that this Root was the Cause thereof , only the precedent Relations made me reflect thereon .

In reply to some queries which a gentlemen of Malta was so obliging as to take with him to Sicily on a visit to the southern part of the island nearest to the volcano , I have been informed that its smoke or vapour was first seen from the shore on the 11th July ; that a few days previous , two or three slight shocks of an earthquake were felt along the coast from Sciacca to Marsala ; that about a fortnight after , the air became dark and loaded with vapours , which at Sciacca had a distinct sulphureous smell ; that the noise of the explosions was sometimes heard as far as Mazzara ; and lastly , that the baths of Sciacca were a little hotter than usual .

I have frequently perceived the smell of phosgene gas on passing the chloride over oxide of zinc ; and as the substance easily liberates chlorine at high temperatures , it will be readily seen how a small portion of that gas may be formed .	It also happens , sometimes , that the protoxides become blackened from the deposition of charcoal .

Hence , though heat in separating chlorine from the perchloride of carbon produces its decomposition , light occasions its reproduction .

And to convince him more fully , that corallines are an animal substance , let him burn them , and he will perceive the same pungent volatile alkaline smell , which he finds in burning horn , hair , or oysters ; whereas burnt fucus ' s and confervas yield a smell not much unlike that of common land vegetables .

So early as the year 1719 , when his curiosity carried him to the coral - fishing on the coast of Provence ; and though intent only upon coral , and neglecting to examine any other marine production , he nevertheless observed , that the extremities of the madrepora were soft , and covered with a mucosity , which had a fishy smell .	From thence he suspected , that therein was contained some kind of animal , but his curiosity stopped here .

After the madrepora had been preserved three days , the animals therein covered its whole surface with a transparent jelly , which melted away , and fell to the bottom of the water as the animal died ; and both the water and madrepora then had a putrid fishy smell .	After having destroyed and consumed all the animals , the extremities of the madrepora became white .

The Trembling returned ; every Muscle was strangely agitated ; he looked as if he were melancholy on the Water , smelt to it , but would not touch it .	Being put into the Stable , a Bucket of pure clean Water was brought to him ; he eagerly thrust his Mouth into the Water , but , endeavouring to suck it , a Convulsion seized him .

The canula seemed to us to be much clogged with sloughs ; and the stench made us suspect a collection and lodgment of these sloughs behind the canula .	We resolved to put in the canula above described ; and as there was a necessity of dilating , in order to introduce it ; we agreed to take the advantage of this dilatation , to try to discover by the crooked forceps , which I had brought with me , if there might not be a stone to be extracted , or at least some more of these excrescences , and to break or bruise such as we should not be able to draw , that they may fall off by suppuration .

This acid is the purest that can be obtained ; it retains Kk a slight odour of the gas , but even this is destroyed by exposure to the air for a few days .	VAUQUELIN observes , that malic acid thus obtained is nearly colourless : his was therefore diluted .

This is all I can say of it at present , till my return to the West Indies , when , if any one desire to know more of it , I shall give them a larger account .
ro3848	smell	of ammonia	strong			from the platinode			Upon opening the apparatus|upon the nitric acid of the nitre		- A solution of nitrate of potassa of the specific gravity 11 17 was substituted for the solution of sulphate of potassa in the last experiment ; five cubic inches of oxygen were given off by the ziincode , and 4 * 3 cubic inches of hydrogen only from the platinode .	Upon opening the apparatus , a strong smell of ammonia was evolved from the platinode side ; evidently indicating a secondary action of the hydrogen upon the nitric acid of the nitre , and accounting for its deficiency .	After driving off the ammonia by heat the solution was still alkaline , and by neutralization indicated 13 .

During the passage of the current , not the slightest particle of gas appeared upon the tin electrode , nor was the slightest smell of chlorine evolved .	The experiment was stopped when twenty - four cubic inches of hydrogen had been collected from the platinode .

The approximation of these numbers to equivalent proportions will be seen in the following Table : From Experiment .

The inflammable air produced in this manner is of the lightest kind , and free from that very offensive smell which is generally occasioned by the rapid solution of metals in oil of vitriol , and it is extricated in as little time in this way as it is possible to do it by any mode of solution .	On this account it occurred to me , that it must be by much the cheapest method that has yet been used of filling balloons with the lightest inflammable air .

ro3909	odour	of the nitrobenzole	perceptible			in the stomach					The vessels of the brain and its membranes were extremely turgid ; the cavities of the heart were full of blood ; the lungs were but slightly congested ; the liver was of a deep purple tint , and the gall - bladder distended with bile ; the stomach was natural , without sign of local irritation ; and the blood all over the body was black and uncoagulated .	Whenever the progress of the case had been quick , and death had taken place within twenty - four hours , the odour of the nitrobenzole was clearly perceptible in the stomach , the brain , and the lungs ; and there was always unmistakeable evidence of the existence of aniline in the organs of the body .	In the slower cases the odour of the poison had often entirely disappeared ; but generally there were distinct traces of aniline in the brain and urine , and sometimes in the stomach and liver ; occasionally , however , no poison was found .

In the first place , I find that dead and decomposing organic matter will effect the change alluded to ; for when nitrobenzole is placed in the dead stomach , or is kept in contact with putrid flesh for several hours , there is a partial reduction of it into aniline .	This may be the source of the poison found in the dead body ; but , on the other hand , there is a great similarity in the physiological effects of nitrobenzole and those of aniline .

The phenyl - compound has the peculiar pungent odour of the ethereal oil of black mustard ; like the latter it possesses the faculty of fixing the ammonias - so much so , indeed , that I did not hesitate to describe the new compound as the mustard oil of the phenyl series .	I almost wonder now that the experiments performed in the phenyl series , and soon afterwards also in the naphthyl series , were not even then extended to the ethylic compounds and their homologues the more so since the study of the action of bisulphide of carbon upon amylamine and ethylamine had , so to say , supplied me with the material for the inquiry .

The powerfully irritating odour of the new ether is absolutely different from that of the ordinary sulphocyanic ether , which , though by no means agreeable , exerts no marked action either upon nose or eyes .	By far the most characteristic feature of the new compound , however , is the facility with which it acts upon ammonia and its derivatives .

Behind the intestine , all along the posterior part of the abdomen , a large quantity of fat was met with of a yellow colour , enclosed in long , thin , transparent ^ membranous bags ; no part of this fat was met with in the prior stages of the tadpole ' s growth .

Downs , who had known him formerly in Venice , invited to see him , which we did at the Castle - Tavern in Pater - Noster - Row ; where , after we had received this Account from himself , he gave us the Satisfaction of viewing the Sore , which continued open , and permitted me without any ComE ee plaint plaint ( the Callosity being great ) to pass my Probe so far into the Sinus , that we concluded it reached into the Kidney : the Matter it then discharged was but little in quantity , but always diluted with and smelt strong of Urine .	The Orifice would sometimes close for three or four Days together , and then the Matter made its way through the common Passages with the Urine , yet without any difficulty or Pain .

When we saw it he applied nothing to the Orifice but a clean Linen Rag , which had a strong Urinous Scent .

ro3992	fragrant|fragrant	Evergreens	the most fragrant|fragrant								And Honorable Mr Boyle hath proved , That even Solid and Coldest Bodies have their Atmospheres ; Some their Electricity ; and some their Magnetismes : And it is palpable , that some draw more Aliment , either from the Earth , or from subterraneous Liquors , or Spirits , or from the Nutritious parts of the Air , or other Influences , which descend through the Air , than they expend in their Atmospheres ; And perhaps more at certain State times , till they have acquired their due Increment .	This being observed , it seems easy to devise , How to examine by Scales , Glasses , and such slight furniture , whence Vegetables , many kinds of Stones , Metals , and other Minerals , have more or less of their Increment , and whence they obtain the stronger Fermentation , which conserves them , or promotes their perfection in their kind : Whether Glass , or what other Materials , do obstruct or retard the resort of any or all of these Spirits , Heats , or Influences : Whether Evergreens , the most fragrant or strong - senting , hot or cold Plants , draw more of their substance from the free Air ; and which draw more from the subterraneal supplies .	And so we may examine Earths ; and Minerals .
ro3996	fragrant|fragrant	some resins	agreeably fragrant|fragrant								This leads the author to inquire into the general action of a slightly elevated temperature on the resins , and he concludes that in all cases when a resin in its normal state is heated a few degrees above its melting point , it begins to suffer partial decomposition , accompanied by the solution of water , and always by more or less of a volatile , generally oily compound , sometimes containing less and sometimes more oxygen than the resin which has been subjected to heat .	In the case of some resins , especially such as are agreeably fragrant , and are expressed by the second of the author ' s general formula ? C40 H24 + x 07 , benzoic acid is one of the products of decomposition at a moderate temperature .	Thus the resin of dragon ' s blood gives only a trace of benzoic acid , with water and a red volatile compound ; while the resin of benzoin gives much benzoic acid .

To the same spirits may also be attributed the power which the acidulae possess , of causing a giddiness of the head , heaviness , and drowsiness , as from intoxicating liquors .

This gas differs from common phosphuretted hydrogen , in not being spontaneously inflammable when mixed with common air , and in being considerably less fetid than that gas .	The proportions of its constituent parts are estimated to be four hydrogen , with twenty phosphorus .

The herring , which was taken out of it the seventh night , and washed from its salt , was found firm and sweet ; but the other herring was very soft and putrid ; much more so than that which had been kept as long in the fresh water of the last experiment .	If a herring , in warm weather , be put into ten gallons of artificial sea - water instead of one , the water will still become luminous , but its light will not be so strong .

From the second and third experiments it is evident , that the quantity of salt contained in sea - water hastens putrefaction ; as the fish that had been kept in water of that degree of saltness was found to be much more putrid than that which had been kept the same time in fresh water .	This unexpected property of sea - salt was discovered by Sir John Pringle , in the year 1750 , and published in the XLVIth volume of the Philosophical Transactions , with many very curious and useful experiments on substances resisting putrefaction ; but the greatest quantity of salt there mentioned , is less than what is found in seawater : it is probable , therefore , that if the sea were less salt , it would be more luminous .

The water , therefore , generally remains till the Sun has exhaled it , by which it becomes putrid , and renders those parts extremely unwholesome , occasioning those deadly putrid severs , which carries off the patient in a few hours , known by the name of pucker fevers .

The process which the contents of the colon undergo , is quite distinct from any thing carried on in the other intestines , since they entirely change their appearance and smell ; and there is commonly a valve to prevent any part of them , even the gases evolved , from being carried up into the small intestines .	The peculiar smell of the feces , which borders so closely on that from putrefaction , although by no means the same , led me to compare them with the animal matter buried in the earth , which is converted into adipocere : in both cases the substance is in the incipient state of putrefaction , but that process never completely takes place ; it is excluded from the external air , is either under water , or within the reach of imbibing moisture ; and there is no substance whatever , the chyle MDcccXIII .

We learn also , that this change is produced just as putrefaction is beginning to take place , and if the substance goes rapidly into putrefaction , no fat is formed , and , what is deserving of observation , the peculiar smell belonging to faces , so different from that of putrid matter , is produced at the time that fat is procured .	Having succeeded in changing animal matter into fat , by adding bile to it out of the b Jdy , I was desirous of ascertaining whether this process could be detected going .

In this paper the author continues his examination of what are called the fetid resins , and from repeated analyses deduces for the resin of Sagapenum the formula C40 H2 ! , O , , , and for that of Galbanum C , l0 H ^ 7 07 .	He then compares the formulae for the four resins : Opoponax = C40 H25 014 , Assafcetida = = C40 H26 Ol0 , Galbanum = C40 Ho7 070 , Sagapenum = C40 H290Q ; and considers it probable that , though no striking analogy among the irrational formulas for these resins is perceptible , by which their analogy in physical properties can be accounted for , that they may possess an analogous rational constitution , which future researches may disclose .

We are told by CHROUET , that the crystalline lens affords , by destructive distillation , fetid oil , carbonate of ammonia , and Cco water , leaving some carbon in the retort .	But , destructive distillation , although it has given us much knowledge as to animal matter in general , is too vague a method for investigating particular animal substances .

When fresh , it has very little smell , or taste .	It causes very little change in the vegetable reactive colours ; and this little would not , I believe , be produced immediately after death .

The compound gradually disappears in water , producing azote , and the water becomes acid , and has the taste and smell of a weak solution of nitro - muriatic acid .	The compound , when introduced into concentrated solution of muriatic acid , quickly resolves itself into gas , producing much more than its own weight of elastic fluid , which proves to be pure chlorine , and the solution evaporated affords muriate of ammonia .
ro4100	aromatic|aromatic		aromatic|aromatic								In order to prepare these substances , which , from their analogy with the essential oil of mustard - seed , I have designated by the name of mustard - oils , the monamines were in the first place treated with bisulphide of carbon ; the alcohol - sulphocarbonates of the monamines thus formed were then submitted to the action of heat and converted , by the loss of 1 molecule of sulphuretted hydrogen , into sulphuretted ureas , which were finally deprived of 1 molecule of monamine by means of anhydrous phosphoric acid .	Circuitous as this process may appear , it has the merit of being a general one , furnishing , in fact , the mustard - oils both of the fatty and aromatic series .	When working with fatty substances , however , the method may be very considerably curtailed .
ro4100	odour	of ethylic mustard - oil	perceptible								E however , this precipitate blackens , even at the common temperature , more rapidly on heating , with formation of sulphide of silver .	Simultaneously the odour of ethylic mustard - oil becomes perceptible ; and if the liquid be heated to ebullition , this oil distils in large quantity with the vapour of water .	The disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen , which is observed at the same time , belongs to a secondary reaction , the unstable hydrosulphide of silver ( which is formed in the first instance ) splitting up into sulphide of silver and sulphuretted hydrogen .
ro4100	odour	Ethyl mustardoil|its	fearful						upon protracted ebullition		In this experiment no excess of silver should be used .	Ethyl mustardoil , more especially upon protracted ebullition , exchanges its sulphur for oxygen , thus giving rise to the formation of cyanate of ethyl , easily recognizable by its fearful odour .	Ultimately this ether is entirely decomposed into carbonic acid and ethylamine ; after some time the solution contains nothing but nitrate of ethylamine .

As has already been pointed out , the new process cannot be used for preparing the mustard - oils of the aromatic series , at all events in the narrower sense of the word .	I may mention , however , that tolylic mustard - oil may be readily obtained by the process which I had formerly used for producing the corresponding compound of the phenyl - series .

ro4100	odour	Benzylamine	penetrating						when distilled with alcohol and mercuric chloride		Experiment has verified this anticipation .	Benzylamine dissolves in bisulphide of carbon with evolution of heat , a beautiful white crystalline compound being formed , which , when distilled with alcohol and mercuric chloride , yields a liquid of a penetrating odour .	On adding water to the alcoholic distillate , the mustard - oil separates in clear drops which are heavier than water .

The new body possesses in an eminent degree the odour of water - cresses .	The resemblance is so striking , that it becomes desirable to examine the essential oil of water - cresses .

The smell emitted by various metals when rubbed may be objected to these conclusions , but the circumstances under which these odours are produced , are such , as not to leave any serious objections on my mind to the opinions above advanced .	I refrain from extending these views , as might easily be done , to the atomic theory , being rather desirous that they should first obtain the sanction or correction of scientific men .

Propyl presented itself under the form of a colouriless , very mobile fluid , having a pleasant odour , and boiling at 68 ? C .	At 18 ? it had the very low density of 0 ' 6745 .

It ' s second principle I take to be an urinous Salt , first because if mixed with salt of Tartar it smells like Sal Armoniac when mixed with the same Salt .	Secondly , when it was distilled with salt of Tartar in a Retort , it afforded an urinous spirit as piercing as the spirit of Sal Armoniac .

No effect has as yet been produced upon the sense of smell by this machine , which is ascribed to the circumstance of the electric effluvia not being expanded in and conveyed by the air , which it is thought is the proper vehicle for exciting sensations in the olfactory nerves .	At the close of the paper the autlior points out the striking analogy there is between this apparatus and the electric organs of the torpedo and electric eel , which are known to consist of membranaceous columns filled from one end to the other with a great number of laminae or pellicles , floating in some liquid which flows into and fills the cavity .

I shall conclude with a request to you concerning a thing , which may prove very much to the advantage of those who are concerned in Mineral adventures : It is a constant opinion amongst our Miners , that Lead - oar discovers it self by an Oily - smell , and that chiefly in a morning a little before the rising of the Sun , especially when some show ' rs have fallen in the night : This being so , I find two things in the Transact .	which give me hopes that this way of discovery may be much improved by Art : The first is an intimation of a way shown by Sr .

I am not ignorant , that some strongly fermented beds of Mineral - earths and rusts , which are sometimes barren , send forth a ranker smell than Oar it self , which may now and then deceive us ; but because for the most part these are concomitants of Oar , we may not look upon the attempt as fruitless .

In my desire to try a variety of substances I took almost anything which my garden afforded , and in this way probably my selection of sage and celery may have been a bad one , as the aromatic ingredients of these plants may be supposed to influence the result of the experiment , especially as in a close vessel any volatile oil would be retained .

The author concludes that the anhydrous acid he has obtained is destitute of oxygen , not only from the various analyses and experiments already referred to , but also , 1st , because the double fluoride from which it was prepared , when fused and electrolyzed with platinum electrodes , evolved abundance of inflammable gas at the cathode , but no gas at the anode , although oxides are by electrolysis decomposed before fluorides ; 2nd , because the electrolysis of the acid with platinum electrodes yielded no odour of ozone , whereas the aqueous acid of various degrees of strength evolved that odour strongly ; and , 3rd , because the properties of the acid obtained from hydrogen and fluoride of silver agree with those of the acid obtained from the double salt .	He considers also that the acid obtained from pure fluor - spar and monohydrated sulphuric acid heated together in a platinum retort is free from oxygen and water .

On being broken , the whole of the contents of this egg were found collected at the smaller extremity in a solid state , but on being put into water , they absorbed a large portion of that fluid , and assumed an appearance not much unlike those of a recent egg ; the smell also was perfectly fresh .	The relative weights of the shell , albunien , and yelk of different eggs are very different .

A faint odour of sulphurous acid was sometimes observed when the reduced cotton was burned , ' and in two or three instances the cotton sustained a slight loss ( from 01 to 03 per cent .	) upon being digested and washed with carbonic bisulphide ; but in other instances the proportion present was only very minute , and the cotton was generally found to be quite free from sulphur .

After cooling , the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen gas very evident , on the addition of diluted muriatic acid , and even of water only .

The decanted liquid of this mixture was found to be chiefly acetite of potash .
ro4235	smell	it|of apples							On dropping diluted sulphuric acid upon the fawn - coloured sediment		The decanted liquid of this mixture was found to be chiefly acetite of potash .	On dropping diluted sulphuric acid upon the fawn - coloured sediment , it constantly emitted the smell of apples , I could not , however , satisfy myself , that the small quantity of liquid decanted from off this sediment contained a kind of vegetable acid for the first time apprehended in the fluids of animals ; because , first , the quantity of product I possessed was so diminishled by many experiments , that I was unable to make what I considered to be decisive trials .	Secondly , because in subsequent processes I failed in producing the same apple .

The distilled liquid did not appear to have received any impregnation , except what had altered a little the odour .	This extract - like residue amounted to one forty - fifth to one eightieth the weight of the expectorated matter , according to the kind of this substance .
ro4235	smell		acid						on heating it with phosphoric or tartaric acid		To determine , by a more satisfactory experiment than a preceding one , whether or not acid was united to the potash and evaporable , ten ounces of watery liquid , which separates from the curd on boiling expectorated matter , were evaporated to the consistence of a thin extract .	This matter indicated neither acid nor alkali in a disengaged state , but it was ascertained to contain a large proportion of potash combined ; and an acid smell was perceived on heating it with phosphoric or tartaric acid .	Ten drops of liquid phosphoric acid were mixed with four hundred grains of this extract - like matter , and at a low temperature it was subjected to distillation to become almost a dry substance , but no acid could be detected in the little liquid which came over , nor did this dry substance indicate any acidity to the usual re - agents - neither on exposure to the air did it , as before the addition of acid , grow moist .

He considers the several Preparations of Opium , and condemns such as are made by the fumes of Sulphur , or by acid Liquors ; in which either the virtue of the Opium is lost , by the evaporation of its Volatile Particles , or destroyed by acid Salts , whose qualities are directly opposite to that of Opium ; the one coagulating or making the Blood viscid , whereas the other attenuates it , and renders it fluid : But he approves of such Preparations of Opium as are made with hot and aromatic medicines , which heighten its Virtue ; and seems to prefer Dr .

These Stones were of a various bigness , from that of a large Nut , or Nutmeg , to a Pepper corn : their colour was of a darkish yellow Ochre , although in some there appeared Laminae of a browner colour : to the touch , when a little dry , they seemed soapy ; their weight was light , and their scent very fetid , resembling that of the purulent matter in the Liver .	Their consistence was friable ; their figure for the most part Triangular , or inclining to that figure , but all Angular ; that side towards the Gall Bag was protuberant and convex , vex , the other two sides were flat ; so that having the lesser Angle towards the Center of the Cavity of the Gall Bag , like so many wedges , they more compleatly filled it : I numbred I think above thirty .

When thesewere exposed to a red heat in a crucible , there was a perceptible smell , like that of horn , hair , or feathers .	The proportion of carbonic matter deposited by the subsequent solution , was more considerable than that of the shells abovementioned ; and the proportion of carbonate of lime , relative to their weight , was less .

ro4312	smell	its	urinous	The							In order to effect the removal of these impurities , the insoluble compound is first decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphuric acid ; if sulphuretted hydrogen is employed , the excess of this gas is afterwards expelled by boiling or better by blowing it out with a current of air .	The acid fluid being now heated with animal charcoal and filtered , loses the whole , or nearly the whole of its colouring - matter , and apparently much of its urinous smell .	Any hydrochloric acid present can be easily separated from the free organic acid by treating the colourless fluid with carbonate of silver and filtering ; the dissolved silver is afterwards eliminated by means of sulphuretted hydrogen , and the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen again removed by boiling the fluid , or passing through it a current of air .

This fluid had a strong smell of urine and the faintest acid reaction .	After the fluid was rendered alkaline by baryta , the smell was in no way diminished ; so that it could not be owing to an acid ; moreover , considering that the colloid acid loses its colour , and apparently in a great measure its odour , after agitation with animal charcoal , we may infer that the odour of urine is owing to a very slight decomposition of the colloid acid which takes place under the influence of heat , and more especially in the presence of free mineral acids .

When burnt it chars , emitting a pungent smell ; the ignition is attended with but a very faint flame , showing that very little hydrogen enters into its composition ; nothing but a trace of fixed inorganic residue remains after complete incineration of the acid .	The colloid acid was found to have no action on polarized light ; it failed to precipitate egg - albumen , but precipitated casein in milk ; the precipitate was not redissolved in an excess of the acid , as in the case of acetic acid ; although strictly a colloid , it passes through the diaphragm of a dialyzer , but the phenomenon is not near so rapid as in the case of crystalloids .
ro4330	smell		worse		than that of a Carrion						As we sunk down and the Damp got still more and more strength , we found that our want of Air perpendicularly from the day was the great cause and nourisher of this Damp ; for the Air that followed down into this Pit , came down at the first sunk Pit at the forementioned distance , after it had been dispersed over all the old hollows and deads of the former work , that were filled up with noysom Vapors , thick smothering Fogs , and in some places with the Smothering - damp it self : Neverthelefs we held on sinking , till we came down to 15 yards , plying the work night and day ( except Sundays and Holidays ) upon which intermission the Pit being left alone for 48 hours and more , and the Damp gaining great strength in the interim , by that time the Workmen went down , they could see it flashing and shooting from side to side like Sword - blades cross one another , that none durst adventure to go down into the Pit : Upon this they took a Pole and bound Candles several times to the end of it , which they no sooner set over the Eye of the pit , but the Damp would fly up with a long sharp flame and put out the Can6 B2 dles , dles , leaving a foul smoke each time behind it .	Findithat things would not allay it , they adventured to bind some Candles at a hook hanging at the Ropes end that was used up and down in the Pit ; when they had lowered down these a little way into the shaft of the Pit , up comes the Damp in a full body , blows out the Candles , disperses it self about the Eye of the Pit , and burns a great part of the mens hair , beards and clothes , and strikes down one of them , in the mean time making a noise like the lowing or roaring of a Bull , but louder , and in the end leaving a smoke and smell behind it worse than that of a Carrion .	Upon this discouragement these Men came up , and made no further trial ; after this the Water that came from it being drawn up at the other Pit was found to be blood - warm , if not warmer , and the Crevisses of the Rocks where the Damp kept , were all about fire - red Candlemas day following .

But that these stones were once wood is I think very certain , for they show the plain vestigia of wood , they likewise burn , cleave ; filings of this stone thrown in the fire emitt a fragrant smell : they cut kindly with a knife , though not so easily , as other wood : but had they none of these properties , the instance now alleged , I think , is as convincing as Demonstration .

Towards Sensation we see , that the medullary Substance of the Nerves at their Extremities is divested of its Coverings , which are Processes of the Dura and Pia Matter , and ends bare in the Form of small soft Papillae , from their Figure , called by Anatomists Pyramidales , on the Surface of the Cutis , covered over with the Cuticula , where they act their Part in Sensation , or Feeling , Tasting , and Smelling .	The soft denudated Branches of the Optic Nerve which compose the Retina , and what for the same Reason is called the Portio Mollis of the Auditory Nerve , the immediate Instruments of Seeing and Hearing , prove the same .
ro4414	Smell						our				In hot Countries , where large Doses of Opium are taken , the Effects are nearly the same with what we observe in Drinkers of distilled Spirits of fermented Liquors ; to wit , a small Dose exhilarates , a greater brings on some Degree of Drunkenness , or temporary Madness ; this increased will lay to Sleep , and a very great Dose will kill .	In this Comparison therefore , may we not justly conclude a Parity in the Causes , from the Similitude of the Effects ; though all the secondary Qualities of such Causes , which offer themselves outwardly to our Senses , be apparently very different ; thus Gunpowder is as much a latent Fire as Brandy , and will exert itself in that Shape to a far greater Degree than it , in equal Circumstances , that is , by the least Contact of Fire ; therefore , I say , that though Brandy and Opium show no outward Resemblance to our Senses in Smell , Taste , Colour , Consistence , and such like secondary Qualities , no more than Brandy and Gun - powder ; yet if in proper and equal Circumstances , that is , in Contact and Mixture with the Blood , they produce the same , or nearly the same Effects , we may justly conclude , that there is a latent Similitude of primary Qualities in their Natures , which they make manifest in proper and equal Circumstances , in producing the same or parallel Effects .	But it has been shown above , how , and in what manner Brandy fetters and entangles the animal Spirits , and other Fluids of the Blood , uniting them too intimately with the grosser Parts , and thereby hindering their due Secretion for some time ; whence a Paucity of Spirits , which discovers itself by an Inequality and Irregularity of their Distribution in Drunkenness ; a still greater Defect in Dullness and Drowsiness ; yet more in Sleep , and a total Suppression of their Secretion , as well to the natural and vital as to the animal Organs , which is Death , the Effect of the greatest Doses either of such distilled Spirits or of Opium .

A Stream of Light will come from the End of it , if it is pointed ; it will attract , repel , and communicate this Virtue to any other non electric Body : On the Approach of a Non - electric , a Spark of Fire , with a Snap attending it , will come from it ; which Spark will be greater or less , as the Bodies approaching it have more or less of the electrical Quality residing in them ; and there will likewise be the same offensive Smell as was observed of the Tube .	From these Experiments , which I think contain the principal Phenomenon of Electricity , may justly be drawn the following Conclusions : 1st .
ro4419	Effluvia|Smell	from the Tube|them|those Sparks of Light	offensive						when rubbed|when the Tube is brought near either of them|on		That there is a mutual Attraction between these Particles , and all other Bodies whatsoever .	That there are Effluvia emitted from the Tube when rubbed , and which surround it as an Atmosphere , is evident , from that offensive Smell arising from them , from that Sensation on the Hands or Face , when the Tube is brought near either of them , and from those Sparks of Light , on a still nearer Approach of the Finger to it .	That the Particles of these Effluvia repel each other , is proved by the Cork - Balls ( Exp .
ro4429	smell						The organ of				The tongue is extremely short , not half an inch long ; and the moveable portion not more than a quarter of an inch ; the papilla on its surface are long , and of a conical form , When the tongue is drawn in , it can be brought entirely into the mouth ; and , when extended , can be projected about a quarter of an inch into the beak .	The organ of smell , in this animal , differs , in some particulars , from that of quadrupeds in general , as well as of birds .	The external openings of this organ are placed nearly at the end of the beak , there being only the lip beyond them ; while the turbinated bones are in the same - relative situation to the other parts of the skull as in quadrupeds ; by which means there are two cavities the whole length of the beak , soperadded to the organ of smell .

The structure of the beak is not such as enables , it to take a firm hold ; but , when the marginal lips are brought together , the animal will have a considerable power of suction , and in that way may draw its prey into its mouth .
ro4433	Smell		Aromatical								By the acrimony and Gummyness , or Oily Taste , we distinguish the Oil of Plants , as well as by Distillation .	The Aromatical Smell shows us the volatility of the Oil and Salt of Plants , and by the ~ we also know that the Oil and Salt are in a volatile state .	By the acrimony and pungency we know that there is a Volatile Salt in Plants , and by their burning taste we find there is a Corrosive Salt in them .
ro4433	smell|smell	the|the	Vinous|pungent	the|the Tartar							By the acrimony and pungency we know that there is a Volatile Salt in Plants , and by their burning taste we find there is a Corrosive Salt in them .	By a crude rough Acidity we observe the Tartar , or essential Salt of Plants ; but if the Acidity be of a Vinous smell , we observe that it is of middle state of Digestion , and may be called a Vinous Tartar , and the Crude Tartar an Acerb Tartar , but if the Tartar had a pungent smell , then it is a Volatile Tartar , or Acid Acrid Tartar .	I will next describe the principles observable in Sweet Tastes , and their several Classes , but mustfirst observe that Sweet Tastes show their Oil by their slimy smoothness , and their Tartar is evident in their extracts , as in the juice of Liquorish .
ro4433	Aromatic|Aromatic		Aromatic|Aromatic								Rrrrrrr Beans Beans and Peas and Lentils have also a Volatile Salt and lens aquatica .	Note , that since there is no Acrimony in these Seeds , the Volatile Salt is produced by the Fire The Aromatic Legumens , as Melilotus , have an exalted Oil , and essential Salt .	Periclymenum is described to have only essential Salt and Oil , but since there is an Aromatic Odor in the flavour , and a great Acrimony , there must be some degree of Volatile Salt in it .

Periclymenum is described to have only essential Salt and Oil , but since there is an Aromatic Odor in the flavour , and a great Acrimony , there must be some degree of Volatile Salt in it .	Fenagreke and Meadow Trefoyl have much Oil and little Salt , and so has Ophioglossum pinguicula & amp ; consolida regalis .
ro4433	Aromatic|Aromatic	Orris	Aromatic|Aromatic								The Sweet Aromatic Burning Tastes contain a Volatile Salt and Oil , as Schenanthus , Ginger , Zed - Oary , Cubebs , Cardamums , Vaynillas , contrayerva calamus arcmaticus ; but these following are mistaken by the Chymist , who say that Costus amarus , dulcis , cyperus , galanga .	Orris , have a Volatile Oil , but essential Salt only , for Orris is Acrid and Aromatic as well as the rest , and therefore there is both Volatile Salt and Oil in them , and also an essential Salt from .	their sweetness .
ro4433	odor|faetid|Aromatics	of Punaises|the Seed				All the parts of Carraways					Note , The Leaves and Roots of Faenil contain a Volatile Oil and Essential Salt , the Seed a Volatile Oil and Sait ; but since the Roots and Leaves have a pungent Taste , there is also a Volatile Salt in them , tho the Chymist do not observe it .	All the parts of Carraways have the odor of Punaises , except the Seed ; from whence I may infer , that the faetid Plants have the same principles as the Aromatics , viz .	a Volatile Oil and Salt ; and this is confirmed by other faetids which have them , as Rue and Assa faetida , and Vulvaria .
ro4433	odor	Peucedanum|of Pitch									a Volatile Oil and Salt ; and this is confirmed by other faetids which have them , as Rue and Assa faetida , and Vulvaria .	Peucedanum is descibed ofr a bitter acid Taste , with the odor of Pitch , and must have a Volatile Salt , tho L ' Emery describes only its essential Salt and Oil : So in Smallage he describes only the essential Salt and Oil , but its Acrid Taste manifests the Volatile Salt .	10 .

THe Grass Sweets , under which are contained all sorts of Grasses and Rushes , Reeds and Corn ; I refer Nymphea Alba to the Rushes , both for its figure and taste , which is crude and styptic , with a bitterishness in the Seed ; but the flowers are like Lillies of a sweet smell , and mucilaginous , sweet , styptic in Taste .	I boiled Horse - tayl a handful in a pint of Water , and I found the Decoction to taste very Styptic with a bitterishness , and the Decoction looked like Small Beer , the Taste being like Rushes : I concluded it to be of the same Class .

Leven is observed by AEtius to be cool by its acidity , to be hot being putrid , and also to have some Virtue from the Salt and Flower .	He observes that Beer is hotter than Barley , and because of its putrefaction it is of an ill juice ; and he also observes , its Windiness depends on the Air included in it ; and the Waterish Beer and the Acid is cooling .
ro4433	smell	Chickweed			of a Cucumber				being bruised		I boiled ~ in a pint of Water , it hath a cooling and moystning quality like common Lychnis .	Dioscorides says , Chickweed being bruised has the smell of a Cucumber .	All the common Lychnis ' s are bitter sweets , and them I shall refer to the class of Bitters , tho their jointed Stalks and Sweetness may justly place them here , yet their chief Physical Virtue is from their Bitterness .

ro4453	smell|smell		sulphureous						during the calcination		The undissolved part of of the horn silver , which remained after its horn silver was extracted by the spirit of hart ' s - horn , retained its black colour .	It was calcined in a crucible , and , during the calcination , a sulphureous smell was observed ; the calcination was continued until this smell ceased .	It had now an ash - colour , silvery appearance , and , during the operation , slightly caked together , which made me think it had yet some horn silver ; I therefore digested it with more spirit of harts - horn ; and , having evaporated the solution slowly to dryness , I obtained thirty - four grains of horn silver ; the undissolved part here remaining , being melted with black flux , produced two drams and a half of pure silver , so that black horn silver is composed of horn silver and sulphurated silver .
ro4453	fumes	of acid of salt	copious								The solution of the three sorts of horn silver in spirit of hart ' s - horn were as colourless as water ; a proof they contain no copper .	To give a proof of the existence of the acid of salt in the horn silver , I took four grains of the cubical crystals obtained in the seventh , eighth , and ninth experiments , and having put them into separate wine - glasses , poured a little oil of vitriol on each , which made them all boil up , effervesce , and send forth copious fumes of acid of salt , just as the like quantity of sea - salt would have done .	It is probable , from the small quantity of this precipitate , that the whole of the tartar of vitriol was not decomposed .
ro4453	smell					out of the phials	I				The neutral salt of the seventh experiment , treated in the like manner , produced eight grains of selenite ; that of the eighth , seven grains and a half ; and that of the ninth ten grains .	In calcining the different specimens of horn silver with the alkalies in the foregoing experiments , I could perceive no smoke or smell issue out of the phials .	Hence I conclude , that the horn silver contained no arsenic ; and that none of it was dissipated during the operation .
ro4453	arsenic	the horn silver									In calcining the different specimens of horn silver with the alkalies in the foregoing experiments , I could perceive no smoke or smell issue out of the phials .	Hence I conclude , that the horn silver contained no arsenic ; and that none of it was dissipated during the operation .	From the foregoing experiments it appears , that the horn silver is composed of silver united to the acids of salt and of vitriol ; and that this last is nearly one - third of these first .
ro4470	smell			the common air	like that of an excited glass tube						When a fog becomes very thick , the cork - balls approach ; but when it returns to its former state , they open again at their first distance ; and I have observed that , when it rained in foggy weather , the balls closed , and opened again on the fog ' s appearance anew , after the rain had ceased : there is , however , a certain degree of density necessary in a fog , in order that the balls might exert their greatest divergency .	Most , if not all , fogs partake of a smell much like that of an excited glass tube , and , indeed , so does the common air very frequently .	As fogs sometimes appear in a very moist state of the air , I was for some time at a loss to account on what principle they could retain their electricity ; but having at length remarked , that electrified bodies , insulated with sealing - wax , preserved their electricity for a time in very damp air , I concluded that moisture is but a very slow conductor .
ro4481	effluvia	human|of marsh maismata									Quibus ex causis , non minus salubritatis quam decoris interest eam contegi .	By the induction of numerous facts , two principal sources of continued fevers have been discovered , that is , the contagion of human effluvia , and of marsh maismata ~ the latter is distinguished by frequently assuming an intermittent type , or changing into a dysentery .	It may be doubted , to which kind of pestilence lence the putrid ditches of twons belong .
ro4481	smell		noisome|offensive	a|atmosphere							The air they breathe at home is thus rendered noxious by respiration and putrefaction .	These miserable wretches , even when they go abroad , carry a poisonous atmosphere round their bodies that is distinguished by a noisome and offensive smell , which is peculiarly disgustful even to the healthy and vigorous , exciting sickness and a sense of general debility .	It cannot , therefore , be wonderful that diseases should be produced where such poison is inspired with every breath .

It cannot , therefore , be wonderful that diseases should be produced where such poison is inspired with every breath .	This noxious air is the most frequent cause of malignant fevers .

This dreadful consequence is naturally to be expected , as putrid steams arising from the diseased body are added to the other increasing causes that produce noxious air .	If a regulation could be universally adopted of immediately removing out of the family such of the poor people as are seized with fevers , it is evident that the most salutary consequences would follow .

The upper Eye - lid in a Week ' s time impostumated , and formed a large Tumor as big as a Hen ' s Egg , which I opened , and kept it so a considerable Time , because I had therefrom a plentiful Discharge of Matter , which was at first very fetid , but afterwards became laudable , giving likewise a good Discharge from the wounded Brain through the Fracture of the upper Part of the Orbit .	In about a Fortnight ' s time I had a very laudable Suppuration from all the Wound , and the Symptoms ceasing , the Dura Matter began to regenerate , looking very red and fresh ; the livid and lacerated Parts sluft off , and the Extremities of the Fracture began to throw out their Ossifications from the Diploe and both Tables of the Cranium , like small Excrescences , or proud Flesh , which in Month ' s time spread over the whole Fracture ; and I made my Observation , that it grew harder sooner at the Extremities of the Fracture than in the Centre The Motions or Pulsations of the Brain still continued , and were very visible for a long Time after , and were felt for some time after the Wound was cured ; especially in the inferior Part of the Coronal and Bregma , over the inferior Part of the Coronal Suture , nigh the Squamosa .

I admitted ammoniacal gas over mercury to a small quantity of the liquor of Libavius ; 23X it was absorbed with great heat , and no gas was generated ; a solid result was obtained , which was of a dull white colour ; some of it was heated , to ascertain if it contained oxide of tin ; but the whole volatilized , producing dense pungent fumes .	Another experiment of the same kind , made with great care , and in which the ammonia was used in great excess , proved that the liquor of Libavius cannot be decompounded by ammonia ; but that it forms a new combination with this substance .

It had no taste nor smell ; it did not seem to be soluble , nor did it undergo any perceptible change when digested in boiling water : it did not appear to be acted upon by sulphuric , muriatic , or nitric acids , nor by a strong lixivium of potash .	The only processes by which it seemed susceptible of decomposition were by combustion , or the action of ignited hydrat of potash .

When acted on by red - hot hydrat of potash , it emitted a smell of ammonia , burnt where it was in contact with air , and appeared to dissolve in the alkali .	The potash which had been so acted upon gave muriatic acid , by the addition of sulphuric acid .
ro4527	smell	of sulphuretted hydrogene									T ' he numbers which represent the proportions in which sulphur and phosphorus unite with other bodies , are such , as do not exclude the existence of combined portions of oxygene and hydrogene in their constitution ; but it may be questioned , whether the opinion which I formed , that the inflammable gas disengaged from them by electricity , is necessary to the peculiar form in which these bodies exist , is not erroneous .	Phosphorus , as I have stated in the last Bakerian lecture , is capable of forming a solid hydruret : and a part of the sulphur distilled from iron pyrites , is usually of a soft consistence , and emits the smell of sulphuretted hydrogene , and probably contains that body .	It is not unlikely , that in all cases , phosphorus and sulphur contain small quantities of the Ihydrurets of phosphorus and sulphur ; and the production of a minute portion of sulphuric acid in the slow combustion of sulphur , is prohydrogene at 35 grains , the Ioo cubical inches , which was not far from the meanv between the estimations of Mr .

The percolating liquid appears quite colourless , and devoid of the usual odour of urine .	A large quantity of urine may thus be passed with the same effect through a small quantity of charcoal ; but at last there arrives a point at which the charcoal , though apparently retaining its decolorizing and deodorizing power undiminished , suffers the liquid to pass through with extreme slowness 136 only , and the latter , after having percolated , appears rather milky , from a small quantity of white matter suspended in it .

But tho ' the Oil of Vitriol be allowed to differ from the volatile Acid of Sulphur , some may imagine , that there is no Difference betwixt this volatile Acid and the volatile Spirit of Vitriol , as it comes over in the Rectification of Oil of Vitriol ; or betwixt our Spirit and the Gas Sulphuris , which is extremely pungent and volatile : But whoever attentively examines and compares the volatile Spirit of Vitriol , or the Gas Sulphuris , with our Spirit , will soon be convinced of a great Difference ; tho ' , indeed , they agree in the Point of Gassy Volatility : For the volatile Spirit of Vitriol is only an impure Phlegm of Vitriol , containing very little Acid , and is chiefly impregnated with the wild Fumes of the Vitriol ; so as , upon standing a while , to quit the Liquor , and leave it nauseous , vapid , and gross ; whereas the volatile Spirit of Sulphur long preserves its Volatility , the purer Gas being here lodged in a pure acid Liquor , less dense and gross than Oil of Vitriol ; so that when , by being long unstopped , this acid Spirit loses of its Volatility ( as it will do ) , yet it never loses of its Acidity ; and even then appears to be the most pure and perfect Mineral Acid we can any way procure .	And , as to the Gas Sulphuris , when made in Perfection ; this is no more than the Fumes of burning Brimstone catch ' d and detained in Water : So that this Preparation , wanting the Acid , cannot be compared , in that respect , with our Spirit , which has it in Perfection .

Whenever the bees quit , their habitation , in this way , I have always observed some fighting to take place ; but - I conceived it to be between the bees of the adjoining hives , and ithose which were removing ; the former being attracted by the scent of the honey , : which thelatter werecarrying off On the farm which I occupy , there were formerly many old decayed trees , the cavities of which were frequently Xocupie by swarms of bees ; and when these were destroyed , a board was generally fitted to the aperture which had been made to extract the honey ; and the cavity was thus prepared for the reception of another swarm , in the succeeding season .	Whenever a swarm came , I constantly observed , that about fourteen days previous to their arrival a small number of bees , varying from twenty to fifty , were every day employed in examining , and apparently in keeping possession of the cavity ; for if molested , they showed evident signs of displeasure , though they never employed their stings in defending their proposed habitation .

A young spaniel brought up with the terriers showed no marks whatever of emotion at the scent of the polecat ; but it pursued a woodcock , the first time it saw one , with clamour and exultation : and a young pointer , which I am certain had never seen a partridge , stood trembling with anxiety , its eyes fixed , and its muscles rigid , when conducted into the midst of a covey of those birds .

This animal , although the tail is horizontal , possesses the sense of smell , since there are orifices in the cerebriform plate of the skull for the olfactory nerves .	While this paper was in the press , I have been so fortunate as to receive from Sir THOMAS STAMFORD RAFFLES , another skull belonging to a dugong , 8 feet long , in which the milk tusks had been shed , and the permanent ones had acquired sufficient length to show the degree they project beyond the bony sockets , and the manner in which they are worn down , by r ; oting up the plants while feeding .

ro4660	odour		very penetrating foetid		similar to that of essence of garlic						In a photograph obtained in this way , the different tints through which the dye - stuiff passes before becoming violet are more or less to be seen , but the deep violet predominates , and represents the black of ordiinary photographs .	The changes in the colour of the purple dye - stuff are accompanied by the productioni of a very penetrating foetid odour , similar to that of essence of garlic .	"The evolution of this odour is as characteristic of the solar actioni as the changes of colour , a consideration of much importance when we desire to solve the problem to which I Inow turn - IUhat was the primitive colour of the purple stuffs of antiquity ? At first sight this question seems to be easily answered ; but when one seeks for a precise signification of the word 6 purple , "" one soon becomes embarrassed ."
ro4660	odour		characteristic foetid								It is only by the initerpretation of the phrases of the ancients , and comparing them with direct observations , that one arrives at a solution of the difficulty , which would appear to be of great use to art .	It is enough to remark that the purple colour exists only because it has been developed by the sun , in justification of the conclusion that the ancients must have been acquiainited with this peculiarity , as also with that of the development of the characteristic foetid odour .	1P1iny , moreover , speaks of both , and helnce it cannot be doubted that the purple was produced formerly exactly as at present , unless we admit that the animals and their dye - stuff have changed , which would be an altogether gratuitous hypothesis .

The brominated oil thus prepared was colourless , very dense , and had a powerful odour , somewhat resembling iodide of amyle .	Although the hyperhalyde was prepared from a fraction of almost constant boiling - point , and purified carefully by distillation on the oil - bath , all coming over below 130 ? being rejected , yet the halyde produced from it was not homogeneous , its boiling - point varying from 80 ? to 150 ? .

ro4680	odour	they									For the clearer proof of which , he makes use of the Urinous Spirit of Sal Armoniac , in which there are two Volatil Salts , an Urinous , and Acid .	These two Salts , saith he , though they be Volatil when separate , yet when united they detain one another , emulating as ' twere the nature of Fixed ones , since they are neither dissolved in the Air , nor emit any odour , as true Volatils are wont to do .	Now to obtain out of this Salt the Urinous volatil Spirit , there is requisite a Separation of these two Salts ; for this bond being dissolved , the Urinous immediately rises .
ro4680	odour	they							before the separation of the volatil parts		The greatest difficulty being thus dispatch ' t , our Author proceeds in the third place to a lesser , yet remaining , which is ; That the Acid part , by means of which the Earth was precipitated , detains the volatil Alcalisat part , and fixes it anew ; so that his Volatil Salt of Tartar hath hitherto acquired no greater degree of volatility , than crude Sal Armoniac or the Flowers thereof are known to have .	For these , though they are made up of volatil parts , yet they diffuse no odour before the separation of the volatil parts ; they also endure the Air ; which no volatil salts , truly such , will do : Wherefore they cannot yet be reckoned among Volatils , strictly so called .	Now then , to give to this Volatil Alcali of Tartar the last and highest degree of Volatilisation , the Author esteems it necessary , there should be made a New addition of Fixed Salt of Tartar , which in the same manner , as before it had freed the Alcalisat part of crude Tartar from its Acid , must here also take from the manifest Acid of crude Tartar the Alcalisat part of the Fixed Salt of Tartar , already freed from Earth ; whereby this Alcalisat part of the Salt of Tartar , truly volatilised , being joined to the water ( which was before added for the free action of the Salts , ) will constitute a most Volatil Spirit , which he saith is coagulable , without addition , into volatil crystals , having the perfect taste of Tartar .
ro4694	odour	sumach			resembling that of tea				when simply boiled with water		When sumach is long kept , the tannin it contains appears to be resolved in a great measure into gallic acid and grape - sugar , owing to its undergoing a species of natural fermentation .	Accordingly under these circumstances when simply boiled with water , sumach emits an odour resembling that of tea , and yields a large quantity of sugar and gallic acid , but mixed with much impurity .	Sumach therefore , though it contains much gallic acid , owing to the impurities present in it , is not a good source of that acid .

To determine how far eggs would stand other tests of a living principle , I made the following experiments .

ro4756	odour				similar to that of ether				On opening the phial		Some weeks afterwards , I found the dark colour of the sulphate had entirely disappeared , a dense black substance had subsided , and the supernatant fluid remained colourless and transparent .	On opening the phial , an odour similar to that of ether was perceived , the fluid had a strong acid taste , and afforded a copious precipitate with nitrate of barytes .	After the black substance had been well washed and dried , a few preliminary experiments , served to show that it was a peculiar compound which had not been noticed .
ro4756	smell		peculiar ethereal								I afterwards found that the substance in question may be readily obtained by boiling the sulphate and alcohol * together for a few minutes ; it separates in small particles , leaving the supernatant fluid colourless , or with only a slight tinge of yellow .	In cases when it is thus procured , a little volatile inflammable fluid , having a peculiar ethereal smell , is also obtained .	The substance , after being washed till the water is tasteless and does not affect litmus paper , and dried at a temperature of about 250 ? Fahrenheit , exhibits the following properties .
ro4756	smell	It	peculiar ethereal						occasioned by the action of the alcohol		It is tasteless , and apparently unaffected either by old or hot water .	It has a peculiar ethereal smell that is not easily removed , and probably arises from the presence of a little inflammable matter occasioned by the action of the alcohol .	It seems to undergo no change by exposure to the air for some time .
ro4756	odour	of acetic acid	very perceptible					in a few minutes			During the agency of alcohol on the powder , acetic acid is produced .	This is shown by putting a little of the powder on a paper filter and moistening it with alcohol ; a moderate action takes place , and in a few minutes , the odour of acetic acid is very perceptible .	In some experiments of this kind , the action , though comparatively feeble at first , has presently increased , the powder has become red hot , and the bottom of the filter completely charred .
ro4756	odour	of acetic acid						soon	if it be then thrown on a filter		If two or three grains of the powder are placed in a glass , and a few drops of alcohol added , in about half an hour acetic acid will be produced ; and as it evaporates and disappears , it may be successively renewed , at longer or shorter intervals , for some weeks , by occasionally adding a little alcohol .	When the powder is boiled in alcohol , it is partially decomposed , and assumes a lighter colour ; if it be then thrown on a filter , the odour of acetic acid is soon perceived , and in a few hours the platinum is found reduced and the paper charred .	When the powder is mixed with flowers of sulphur , and heated , a sulphuret of platinum is formed of a blue colour .
ro4756	odour				resembled the nitrous acid						) Examination of the fluid .	The fluid which rose in the neck of the retort reddened litmus paper , and resembled the nitrous acid in odour , colour , and taste .	It acted upon the mercury in contact with the retort , and when washed out by pure water , the solution did not affect the nitrate of barytes , or silver .
ro4756	odour	a|of sulphureous acid	perceptible	vapour					When it is gently heated by a spirit lamp		It is not decomposed by being boiled in water or in weak alkaline solutions .	When it is gently heated by a spirit lamp on a slip of platinum , a violent action is produced , and a dense white vapour is exhaled , in which the odour of sulphureous acid is perceptible , the substance becomes ignited , and is presently decomposed , leaving the reduced platinum in small grains .	iiWhen this compound is decomposed by heat in close vessels over water or mercury , it yields a grey sulphuret of platinum , * nitrogen , sulphureous , carburetted hydrogen and carbonic acid gases , carbonate of ammonia , and an oily , like fluid .

It is commonly asserted by the Seamen , that they can smell the Pines at Virginia several Leagues at Sea before they see Land , but I could receive no satisfaction as to this Point ; I could not discern any such thing when at a moderate distance , I fear much of this may be attributed to Fancy ; for one day there came three or four full sent to tell me they were certain they smelt the Pines ; but it afterwards proved that we were at that time 200 Leagues from the Shore , so that I was satisfied that was therefore mere Fancy .	Indeed we thought , by the general Accounts of the Ship , that we had been just on the Coast , but all were deceived by a Current we met with , that at that time set about South - East , or East South - East , which when once becalmed we tried thus : We hoised out a Boat , and took one of the Scuttles that covered one of the Hatches of the Ship , tying thereto a great Weight , and a strong long Rope , we let it sink a considerably Depth , and then fastning it to the Boat , it served as an Ancor , that the Boat could not drive ; then with the Glass and logg Line we found the Current set , as I say , Eastward , at the rate of a Mile and a half an hour .

I have been told by very serious Planters , that 30 or 40 years since , when the Country was not so open , the Thunder was more fierce , and that sometimes after violent Thunder and Rain , the Roads would seem to have perfect casts of Brimstone ; and it is frequent after much Thunder and Lightning for the Air to have a perfect Sulphureous Smell .	Durst I offer my weak Reasons when I write to so great Masters thereof , I should here consider the nature of Thunder , and compare it with some Sulphureous Spirits which I have drawn from Coals , that I could no way condense , yet were inflamable ; nay , would burn after they passed through Water , and that seemingly fiercer , if they were not over - power ' d therewith .

They further believe , that if this Animal comes so near the Surface of the frozen Earth , as to smell , or discern the Air , he immediately dies , which they say is the Reason that several of them are found dead on the high Banks of the River , where they unawares come out of the Ground .	This is the Opinion of the Infidels concerning these Beasts , which are never seen .

If there were any Bolts I cannot tell , for I have searched diligently , but have found no such thing ; there is indeed several Breaches in the Walls , and its even to the Admiration of many , ( if Providence had not so ordered ) how the School could have stood , for there is Five Breaches in the Walls , to wit , one in the Roof , exactly in shape like a Cannon Ball , another under the Chimney , a third came through the back Wall , and quite through the other Wall opposite to it , and the Chimney was split in pieces , and some that came to the School - door and made a breach there , renting the Stones in pieces , and carried them out : There were Four of us killed , to wit , a Son of James Chiens , and George Gordons in Ardo and Alvy in the Parroch of Old Deer , with a Brother of my own , and many of the rest hurt , having their Legs or Arms Ruined , but are all , I thank God Recovered ; and as for my self , I never was in greater danger , for there was one killed before me , another at my left hand , and not half a Foot from me there was a breach made in the middle Wall of my Chamber , and yet , I thank God I received no hurt , only I was bled in the Mouth , but how I cannot tell ; as to the Childrens Bodies that were killed , really I cannot give you so very distinct an Account , for I was a little Confused at the time ; but however I looked them , but found none of their Bones broken , save my Brother had a cut in his Head ; and all of them , where they received the Strokes had their Cloaths cut , as if it had been eat out with Rats ; they all received their Strokes on their Vital Parts , as about the Shoulders , which were in Colour of a Brownish Black .

They were not withered , though they were not grown ; only the leaves had in the middle a little changed their colour , and had a smell somewhat sowrish ; but the next morning the plant was quite spoiled .	We may believe that the pressure of the Air had made the water enter into this plant with so great a violence , that thereby it had , as ' twere , mortified the parts , especially in the middle where the leaves were most tender ; but this water still kept the leaves extended , and so they withered not ; but , when the Air came to act upon them , the parts of the Plant that had so much suffered were soon corrupted by it .

This being so Destructive and Prolifique an Insect , for of Seventy Eggs I found but one Barren , and three with dead Worms , I thought of a way to destroy them , which is thus : I took a Glass Vessel , and put into it Eight Moths , and firing some Brimstone therein , they were soon killed by its fume : and three hours after putting some more Moths into the Vessel , the Scent that remained therein killed them ; from hence guessing at what might serve for a larger Room , I took for a Granary 24 Foot long , and 16 broad , 1 / 4 of a Pound of such Brimstone , prepared so as Wine - Coopers use to do for their Casks , which ( securing it from danger of firing the Room ) I placed in the midst of the Room , and setting it on fire , left it , shutting the Door , and after two days I came again , and found some Moths alive on the Walls , but not a tenth of what used to be there , and which I judged might get into the Room through the broken Glass of the Window , or they might have crept out of the Aurelia after the Smoke was over : Wherefore the best way is to smoke the Room as soon as the Moth appears , and that for some days successively , which is but a small charge .	And in Autumn it would do well to sweep the Worms off the Walls , for being a tender Infect , they are easily killed .
ro4895	aromatic|aromatic	Crude furfurol|oil|metafurfurol	aromatic|aromatic				I				Furfurol is also produced by boiling any kind of madder with solution of sulphate of aluminium .	Crude furfurol , whether obtained from madder , bran , sawdust , or any other of its usual sources , is always contaminated with another aromatic oil , which I called metafurfurol .	This has a higher boiling - point , and oxidizes more readily than furfilrol , so that by repeated rectification almost the whole of it is converted into a brown resinous matter , which remains in the retort .
ro4895	odour	It	much more agreeable								A much simpler and more effective method , however , of purifying furfurol from this substance consists in digesting it for some hours with very dilute sulphuric acid , to which small quantities of acid potassium chromate are added from time to time ; this effectually destroys the metafurfurol and other impurities , so that the furfurol which distils over after being separated from the water and dried over fused chloride of calcium has a constant boiling - point of 161 ? C .	It has a much more agreeable odour than before , is nearly colourless , and may be exposed to the air under a layer of water for months , without any considerable increase of colour .	Its refractive index for the D line at 20 ? C .

It appears , therefore , from these experiments , that it is only the bases of the aromatic series which combine with furfurol to yield these peculiar - coloured salts in a crystalline state .	I cannot conclude this paper without acknowledging the very efficient aid I have received from my assistant , Mr .

And as the oil of turpentine being in some degree an electric per se , would not conduct what came up from the floor , the electricity was obliged to jump from the end of one chain to the end of the other , which he could see in large sparks ; and thus it had a fair opportunity of seizing of the finest particles of the oil in its passage , and carrying them off with it : but no such effect followed , nor could he perceive the least difference in the smell of the electrical effluvia thus collected , from what it had when collected otherwise ; nor does it otherwise affect the body of the person electrified .	He likewise put into a phial , instead of water , a strong purging liquid , and then charged the phial , and took repeated shocks from it ; in which case every particle of the electrical fluid must , before it went through his body , have first gone thro ' the liquid , when the phial is charging , and returned through it when discharging ; yet no other effect followed than if the phial had been charged with water .

He has also smelt the electrical fire , when drawn thro ' gold , silver , copper , lead , iron , wood , and the human body , and could perceive no difference ; the odour being always the same , where the spark does not burn what it strikes ; and therefore he imagines , that it does not take that smell from any quality of the bodies it passes through .	There was no abridging this experiment , which I think very well conceived , and as well conducted , in a manner to make it intelligible ; and therefore I have laid the author ' s words nearly before you .
ro4924	Smell		so putrid|deadly|extremely nauseous								Rose , the Wife of Mortaugh Mac Cornwall , of the Parish of Tullylish , Barony of Clare , in the Year 1741 , about the latter End of May , or the Beginning of June , being in the 37th Year of her Age , and Mother of several Children , conceived , as usual ; but , in two or three Days after , felt an excessive unnatural kind of Pain in the Matrix , which continued , with frequent Faintings , a depraved Appetite , and an exceeding great Weakness , till her Child quickened ; after which she proceeded reasonably well in her Pregnancy to the End of nine Months ; and then , her Child alive , and every thing right ( as the Midwife thought ) , she fell in Labour , which lasted , with proper Child bearing Pains , for twenty - four Hours , but could not be delivered ; and her Labour leaving her , the Child was no more observed to stir .	In a Month after , her Labour returned , and , with many regular Throws , continued twenty - four Hours more , but to no Purpose , save the discharging of some Quantities of black corrupted Clods of Blood ; of which kind also she threw up much by Vomit : Then her Labour left her entirely ; and soon after she felt the decaying of the Flesh of her Infant , and the Discharge thereof both by the Matrix and Anus , with so putrid and deadly a Smell as was extremely nauseous both to herself and others about her .	Thus she lived for upwards of twelve Months , and , at that Period her Pains increasing to Excess , she began the discharging of the Bones , which , to the Number of 80 and upwards , she voided wholly by Siege ; 14 the first Day , and 2 , 3 , or 4 , at a time afterwards for the Space of twelve Months or more , with most intolerable Pains at the voiding of each Bone , especially a broad Piece of the Scull : So that , from her Conception to the Day of her Death , which was the 4th of April last , makes up near four Years ; during most of which Time , never was a more calamitous Creature : For three Years , scarce a Day without suffering most exquisite Torture , being also attended with frequent Faintings , a continual Want of Appetite , and an almost perpetual Looseness ; insomuch that it is miraculous how she lived , not eating all that long Space so much as would have sustained a sucking Infant ; even the very Liquids , at length , not lying a Moment in her Stomach ; by which means she became quite emaciated , and dismal to look at , not being able to move from one Posture to another , or to be moved , without fainting at every the least Touch or Motion .

This acid distillate was redistilled , when it proved to be free from sulphuric acid .
ro4933	odours					thro ' the pores of glass	the Italians				This treatise , from the misfortune which we labour under from the present bad state of health of our excellent president , to whom it was sent , has not as yet been presented in form to the Society ; but as you have already much interested yourselves in investigating the truth of the facts , which occasioned this publication , I take the liberty , from a copy thereof sent me at the same time by my kind friend and correspondent the Abbe Nollet , to lay before you a short account thereof .	This indeed may be now thought less necessary , as , since the Abbe ' s journey to Italy , and our want of success here in our attempts to do the like , every body has considered what the Italians printed upon the transmission of odours thro ' the pores of glass , and upon the subject of medical electricity , Read March 12 , electricity , as too hasty a publication .

The second class includes experiments made with tubes and globes , which have nothing within them ; but the persons electrised hold in their hands , or sometimes place under their naked feet , odoriferous , purging , or even the most poisonous substances , in order to observe , whether the persons electrised in this manner would be sensible of the effects of these substances .

THinking it fit to try , as well , Whether stinking Fish that shines be of the same nature , as to Luminousness , with rotten Wood that shines too ; as , whether the withdrawing of the Air will extinguish or eclipse the Light of a considerable bulk of luminous matter , as in the Experiments hitherto made , we found it would do to a small one : We took a Fish that we had kept , and caused to be watched ' till it was almost all over Luminous , though much more in the Belly , and some parts of the Head , than elsewhere : And having suspended him in a conveniently shaped Receiver , we found him to give so great a light , that we suspected beforehand , that the withdrawing of the Air would hardly have its full operation upon a Body , whose bulk was considerable , as well as its light very vivid , and which had many luminous parts retired to a pretty distance from the Air .	Accordingly having exhausted the Receiver as much as we were wont , it appeared indeed , especially towards the latter end of the operation , that the absence of the Air did considerably lessen , and in some places eclipse the light of those parts that shone less strongly .

ro4959	fumes		acid								Though no change is produced in corrosive sublimate by oil of turpentine under the influence of light , a considerable action and mutual decomposition is the result of a mixture of the two being gently heated .	On the application of a gentle heat to corrosive sublimate in fine powder moistened with oil of turpentine , the mixture becomes of a fawn colour ; there is a sudden and considerable elevation of temperature , acid fumes are generated , calomel is formed , and if the heat be raised , a residue of carbon is obtained .	The results appear to be modified by the proportions of the two substances : when the quantity of corrosive sublimate is large , the whole of the oil appears to be completely decomposed , and the products are , liquid muriatic acid , calomel , and charcoal : when the oil is in excess , the part that escapes decomposition , passes over 859 impregnated with muriatic acid ; and , judging from its smell , appears to contain a minute quantity of artificial camphor .

The other substances obtained along with the naphthaline were ammoniacal water , and an oil of a bituminous and aromatic odour , boiling at 2100 , and not congealing at 320 , highly inflammable , and readily soluble in alcohol and ether : there was also produced , during the latter part of the distillation , a yellow farina precipitable from its alcoholic solution by water , and fusible .

ro4983	odour				is somewhat similar to that of aldehyde				during the transformation		Submitted to the action of nitrous acid , this base is decomposed with evolution of nitrogen ; in the first stage of the reaction an indifferent crystalline body is produced , and the final result of the process is a large quantity of pure oxalic acid .	The nitrogen evolved during the transformation is accompanied by a very volatile liquiid , the odour of which is somewhat similar to that of aldehyde .	At the time when I made these experiments I really believed the liquid to be aldehyde , but since I failed in obtaining the crystalline compound with ammonia and in transforming it into acetic acid , I abstained from mentioning this reaction in my note to the Royal Society .

Q .
ro5001	smell	Pure antimony|arsenic	the least garlick -						when burnt		Besides , if the reguline part of antimony was really mercurial , how comes the mercury not to fly off entirely in a strong calcination , especially in such an intense heat as that of the burning - glass ? And if it doth so , as some have asserted , how comes the remaining calx , after suffering such a violent action of the fire , to be so readily reduced to its pristine reguline metallic state , merely by the addition of any common phlogiston , as sulphur , charcoal - dust , animal fat , or the like ? But indeed mercury in no form will stand such an intense heat , but is soon totally evaporated ; and so would the regulus , if mercurial ; the calx of which however , after having stood this fiery trial , is , as I said , easily revived into a proper regulus .	Pure antimony differs from arsenic in not having the least garlick - smell , peculiar to arsenic when burnt .	Nor is the antimonial regulus at all soluble in water , as arsenic , nor in oil of tartar per deliquium , in which however white arsenic almost entirely dissolves .
ro5001	smell	of the oil of vitriol	strong sulphureous						when forced off by distillation		It is thus also in the humid calcination , when strong spirit of vitriol is poured on the reguline mass , which it tears abroad , and lets loose the phlogiston ; for this calx likewise is not reducible to regulus but by some sulphureous pabulum , in close contact and fusion with it .	The strong sulphureous smell of the oil of vitriol , when forced off by distillation , or the like , discovers the phlogiston , and whence it came .	Moreover this calx is entirely white , and will not in the least deflagrate with salt - petre ; an argument of the absence of any sulphureous matter .
ro5001	smell		sulphureous antimonial						by being digested with it in a very gentle heat of the sun		And thus indeed the vegetable acids act on iron or copper ; which neither pure water , nor pure spirit , will affect , but are most readily dissolved by wine , cider , juice of lemons , or the like .	This leads me , however , to make the following observations : That though simple water is ineffectual in drawing off any thing emetic from pure regulus of antimony , yet certainly rain , or river - water , in some measure , acts on the body of crude antimony , and extracts from it a milky hue , and a sulphureous antimonial smell and taste , by being digested with it in a very gentle heat of the sun , or fire .	And this water , by the way , so impregnated , hath been very often found of great service in cutaneous and other disorders , when drunk freely .
ro5001	smell		very strong sulphureous						when these acids are poured on antimony		In like manner oil of vitriol , or spirit of nitre , two concentrated and exceedingly fiery acids , tear abroad regulus of antimony , and reduce it to a calx , by letting loose the phlogiston , or sulphureous principle , whence the metallic substance is quite decomposed .	And that this is the case , seems evident from the very strong sulphureous smell , that arises , when these acids are poured on antimony .	Indeed oil of vitriol takes up the inflammable part of antimony , and unites with it into an actual mineral sulphur .
ro5001	nauseous|nauseous		nauseous|nauseous							a suffocation and convulsions	That the destruction of the internal sulphur of the reguline substance , in these calcinations , is the destruction of the reguline form , and of course of the emetic power of the antimony , appears in part from what I have said above , and will be more manifest by attending to the following experiments .	I have very frequently given it with success , from ten to thirty drops , to children of a year or two old , in the chin - cough , and asthmatic oppressions , when an attempt to force down more nauseous medicines had endangered a suffocation and convulsions .	Should it be imagined , that this medicine , being so safe and easy , can have no great efficacy as an alterative and diaphoretic ; I answer , that as it is capable , in a proper dose , of irritating the stomach and intestines so strongly , it cannot be supposed , even in very small doses , to lie inactive in the sanguineous and lymphatic arteries ; and both seems , and eventually is , exceedingly well adapted to stimulate and scour the whole vascular system .
ro5001	aromatic|aromatic	essence of antimony|the vinum antimoniale	aromatic|aromatic								And , as stibiate medicines are now so much in vogue , this little piece may not be an improper thing to be put into the hands of students in physic : perhaps it may excite even some of the more experienced to improve and ascertain the virtues and doses of antimonials , which at present are not a little undetermined .	Besides , I had also a further view in drawing it up , which is to recommend the use of what I have called essence of antimony , or the vinum antimoniale ( for the aromatic in it is of no great importance ) , as much the most safe and useful preparation thereof .	I have used a great variety of antimonial medicines for near thirty years ; and must say , from sufficient experience , I greatly prefer this to any other , though I am far from condemning all the solid preparations of antimony ; but I assert no one of them hath greater or better effects in medicine than this ; and very few , if any , can be given with equal safety .
ro5003	smelling		strongly		of vinous ether						To one equivalent of chloroform were added , by degrees , three equivalents of dry and powdered ethylate of soda , a violent action taking place with the evolution of much heat ; the liquid was entirely distilled from the residue ( chloride of sodium ) by means of an oilbath , and then subjected to a series of fractional distillations , which yielded a small distillate between 50 ? and 60 ? C .	, smelling strongly of vinous ether , a large distillate ( about three - fourths of the whole ) between 77 ? and 78 ? C .	, which was chiefly alcohol , and another small distillate ( about one - sixth ) between 145 ? and 145 3 ? C .
ro5003	odour		strongly aromatic								This compound which boils at 145 ? to 146 ? C .	is a colourless limpid liquid , only slightly soluble in water , having a strongly aromatic odour , readily inflammable and burning without much smokle ; its specific gravity is ' 8964 ; it remained liquid at 00 F .	Several analyses made of this body agree in giving to it the formula C7 H6 , 03 , which would also be the empirical formula of a tribasic formic - ether ; the density of its vapour also corresponds very closely with the same formula .

Pentachloride of phosphorus added to a portion of the compound produced a heavy liquid having the odour of chloroform .	A small quantity of the body was dissolved in alcohol , distilled upwards for two or three hours with solid hydrate of potash and then distilled off ; the residue was next dissolved in water and made exactly neutral by hydrochloric acid , filtered to remove the turbidity , and then a few drops of chloride of mercury added ; after a little time and by the application of heat , a very slight precipitate of subchloride of mercury was formed ; .
ro5003	smell	of vinous ether	same						In		, and its analysis agreed almost exactly with the formula .	In this process the lowest distillate had the same smell of vinous ether which was before observed in the other methods .	An attempt was made to produce the intermediate compounds CH Cl , , AeO , and CH C1 , 2AeO , by adding dry and powdered ethylate of soda very gradually to a large excess of chloroform ; but the liquid after being separated from the precipitate , was found , on distilling fractionally , to resolve itself into chloroform , alcohol , and the body ( C7 H16 O0 ) already obtained , the presence of no other substance being observable .
ro5004	fumes|fumes|smelled|fumes	the	very copious	fumes|fumes	of sulphur						219 .	Six ounces of fine tessellated lead ore were put into a crucible and exposed , at first , to a gentle , afterwards to a strong fire : the ore grew red , and emitted fumes which smelled of sulphur ; at length it melted , and the fumes became very copious ; they were accompanied with a yellowish flame upon the surface of the melted ore , and when collected had a whitish appearance .	The crucible after the ore had continued a full hour in perfect fusion was taken from the fire , and when it was cold it was broken .
ro5004	fumes		heavy								The mass which it contained weighed five ounces and an half ; there were no scoria observable on its surface , nor were any particles of metal formed , it was still an ore of lead .	The mass remaining from the last experiment was put into a fresh crucible , and exposed to a strong melting heat ; the fumes which arose from it seemed to be heavy ; they brooded over the surface of the melted mass in undulating flames , which now and then appeared like burning zinc .	These experiments prove , that some substance or other is contained in lead ore , which must be dispersed before the ore can be formed into lead ; and they show too , that it requires a considerable time to effect the dispersion of this substance , since six ounces of ore , though kept three hours or more in complete fusion , were not wholly brought into the form of lead ; and , lastly , they render it probable , that the fumes , arising from melted ore , carry off with them no inconsiderable portion of the lead itself .
ro5004	fumes	from melted ore									The mass remaining from the last experiment was put into a fresh crucible , and exposed to a strong melting heat ; the fumes which arose from it seemed to be heavy ; they brooded over the surface of the melted mass in undulating flames , which now and then appeared like burning zinc .	These experiments prove , that some substance or other is contained in lead ore , which must be dispersed before the ore can be formed into lead ; and they show too , that it requires a considerable time to effect the dispersion of this substance , since six ounces of ore , though kept three hours or more in complete fusion , were not wholly brought into the form of lead ; and , lastly , they render it probable , that the fumes , arising from melted ore , carry off with them no inconsiderable portion of the lead itself .	At the great smelting houses in Derbyshire , they put a ton of ore at a time into the furnace , and work it off in eight hours ; the ore might be wholly melted in one hour , but the lead perhaps is not formed in the greatest possible quantity in eight hours .
ro5004	smell		strong	the stopple of the quilled receiver	resembling that of the inflammable air separable				as soon at the ore felt the fire		Some fine tesselated lead ore from Derbyshire was pounded into small lumps , each about the size of a pea , and carefully picked from spar and other impurities .	Sixteen ounces of this ore , thus previously cleansed , were distilled in an earthen retort ; as soon at the ore felt the fire , the stopple of the quilled receiver had a strong smell resembling that of the inflammable air separable from some metals by solution in acids ; soon after a small portion of a liquid came over into the receiver ; the fire was then raised till the retort was of a white heat , when a black matter began to be sublimed into the neck of the retort ; the operation was then discontinued .	This experiment was undertaken with a view of seeing whether sulphur could be separated from lead ore , as it may be from some species of the pyrites , by distillation , and it appears from the issue of the experiment that it cannot .
ro5004	smell	The liquid	pungent		resembling that of the volatile vitriolic acid						The liquid did not effervesce with either acids or alkalies ; nor did it produce any change in the colour of blue paper , though I am certain , from experiment , that one drop of oil of vitriol , though diluted with two ounces of water , would have produced a sensible redness on the blue paper which I used .	The liquid , notwithstanding , had an acid taste , and a pungent smell , resembling that of the volatile vitriolic acid .	The experiment ought to be repeated with a larger quantity of ore , in order to ascertain the quantity and quality of the liquid , separable therefrom by simple distillation .
ro5004	sulphur|smell		pungent								Its apparent purity might induce a belief that it contained no heterogeneous mixture , yet the following experiments show how much we should be deceived in forming such a conjecture , and how rightly it is denominated crude sulphur .	From one hundred and twenty parts , by weight , of lead ore , I obtained , by solution in acid of nitre , subsequent washing in hot water , and drying by a gentle fire , forty parts of a substance which looked like sulphur : these forty parts were put on a red - hot iron , the sulphur was made manifest by a blue flame and pungent smell .	When the flame went out , there remained upon the iron unconsumed twenty - six parts of a greyish calx ; the weight of the sulphur which was consumed must therefore have amounted to fourteen parts , or between one eighth and one ninth part of the weight of the ore .
ro5007	smell	of aldehyde	strong						on adding more chromic acid		A portion of it was oxidized with a cold diluted solution of chromic acid .	No gas was evolved , but a strong smell of aldehyde was perceived , which disappeared on adding more chromic acid .	On distilling to dryness , an acid liquid was obtained , which was neutralized with sodium carbonate .
ro5007	odour	of aldehyde	strong						A diluted cold solution of chromic acid|on further addition of the oxidizing liquid		I did not isolate the glycol in the pure state , but proposed to establish its structure by oxidation .	A diluted cold solution of chromic acid acts violently on it , carbon dioxide being evolved in abundance , and a strong odour of aldehyde being recognized , which , on further addition of the oxidizing liquid , was changed into that of acetic acid .	By distillation an acid liquid was obtained , which , on boiling : with silver carbonate , yielded a silver - salt , which crystallized in the well - known needles of silver acetate .

YEfternight when I was about to go to bed , an Amanuensis of mine , accustomed to make Observations , informed me , that one of the Servants of the house , going upon some occasion into the Larder , was frighted by something of Luminous that she saw ( notwithstanding the darkness of the place , ) where the meat had been hung up before : Whereupon suspending for a while my going to rest , I presently sent for the meat into my Chamber , and caused it to be placed in a corner of the room capable of being made considerably dark , and then I plainly saw , both with wonder and delight , that the joint of meat did in divers places shine like rotten Wood or stinking Fish ; which was so uncommon a sight , that I had presently thoughts of inviting you to be a sharer in the pleasure of it .	But the late hour of the night did not only make me fear to give you too unseasonable a trouble , but being joined with a great Cold I had got that day by making Trial of a new Telescope ( you saw , ) in a windy place , I durst not sit up long enough to make all the trials that I thought of and judged the occasion worthy of .

Lazarus , was formerly an Hospital for Leprous People , but that Disease being ceased in this last Age ( since the Pox has been separated from it ) these Lazar Houses have been converted to other Uses ; and it may not be perhaps foreign to my purpose to take notice that the Writ de Leproso amovendo contained in the Register of Writs was , ( according to Coke upon Littleton , ) to prevent Leprous Persons associating themselves with their Neighbours , who appear to be so by their Voice and their Sores ; and the Putrefaction of their Flesh ; and by the Smell of them .	Well then , let us examine what Method was to be taken to prevent this noysom and filthy Distemper , the Leprosy ; why truly that which would infallibly prevent their getting the Pox after the usual Method , and that was Castration .

Their composition being nearly always indicated in advance by theory , it is not my intention to examine these various derivatives in detail , but I shall avail myself of the two easily accessible diamines which I have described , for the purpose of establishing by a few numbers the chief characteristics of the diatomic bases corresponding to the aromatic monamines .

"Trinitronaphtaline might thus yield a basic compound , ( C0lo IH ) ' "" l C1O H1N , = 113 N3 ; 113 and even the triatomic base of the phenyl - series might possibly be obtained in this manner ; for although we have not at present trinitrobenzol at our disposal , we could submit the nitro - bases themselves to further amidation ."

I have satisfied myself by experiment that phenylene - diamine may be just as well obtained by the reduction of nitraniline as of dinitrobenzol ; and it deserves therefore to be ascertained whether dinitraniline will yield the compound ( Co 113 ) ' C H9 N3 = 3 N , 3J which would be the first aromatic triamine .

Every where else in the arm and forearm , from the axilla downwards , the skin was separated from the muscles , and between these parts there was a dark coloured fluid , with an offensive smell , and sloughs of cellular membrane resembling wet tow , floating in it .	The muscles had their natural appearance every where , except on the surface , which was next the abscess .

Such as tools being overheated and by being so , loosing their temper ; the breaking of optic glasses in grinding ; bodies becoming electrical , and odorous by rubbing ; and the like ; from all which he concludes , that such local motions as are wont to be past by unobserved , may have a notable operation upon such bodies as are peculiarly disposed to admit it , and so have a large share in natural productions .

ro5174	effluvia	from the earth|the Air	friendly								Of these he makes two sorts , some constantly are sent up into the Air , which he calls ordinary Emissions ; others ascend only at times , these are extraordinary emissions ; these again are periodical or fortuitous .	This doctrine he endeavours to illustrate by asserting , first , that in divers places the salubrity or insalubrity of the Air considered in the general , may in good part be due to subterraneal expirations , especially to those he before called ordinary emissions for this he appeals to experience , which finds some places more healthy then the manifest qualities would permit one to expect ; this effect he therefore ascribes to the friendly effluvia from the earth , and argues from the observations in Hungary , and Bohemia , where the Air is impregnated with mineral exhalations , suitable to the Oar the Earth contains under it .	on the 18th of May , between one and two of the Clock in the Afternoon , there was at Santorini an Earthquake , which was not violent , and continued but a Moment : And in the Night between the 22d and 23d , there was also another , which was yet less sensible than the former .
ro5177	Smell		ill				the Fishermen		every time they passed by that place		What inclines me to think the contrary , is , that the Height it is at present above the Surface of the Sea , and which is did not arrive to in less than 3 Years time , is much less than that from the Bottom of the Sea to the Surface of the Water , as I shall show hereafter .	Add to this , that a long time before these Earthquakes , the Fishermen perceived an ill Smell every time they passed by that place ; which shows that the Island had then begun to move : Notwithstanding it is very certain , that there have not been any other Earthquakes at Santorini , than those , which , 14 or 15 Years ago , continued for several Days , and were very violent .	Howsoever it was , some Seamen discovered this Island early in the Morning ; but not being able to distinguish what it was , they imagined it to be some Vessel that had sussered Shipwreck , and was driven thither by the Sea .
ro5177	Smell	it	very ill								The Smoke appeared first upon the 16th of July : At which time , from a place in the Sea , where ( they assured me ) they could never before find any Bottom , and which was above 60 Paces distant from the New Island ( which they then called the White Island ) there rose up a Ridge of Black Stones , which the Greeks , by reason of their hardness , call Sideropetres , or Iron - Stones , which formed another Island , named by the Inhabitants the Black Island ; and which was afterwards not only the Center of the whole Island , but also of the Fire , and Smoke , and great Noise , that was heard some time after .	The Smoke , which issued out of this Ridge of Stones , or Black Island , was very thick and white , as if it had proceeded from 5 or 6 Lime - Kilns joined together ; and being carried by a North Wind towards the Castle of Acrotiri , it went into the Houses of the Inhabitants , but without causing any great annoyance , because it had no very ill Smell .	Four Days after the Smoke had thus appeared , they saw in the Night time Fire issuing out from the same place .
ro5177	smell	it	very ill								The first who brought this sorrowful News was a poor honest Man , who failed not early every Morning to visit his small Vineyard , and was not a little rejoiced to see it so well stored with plenty of good Fruit : He went as usual , not dreading this unlooked for Calamity ; and finding it all thus unexpectedly blasted , was struck with such sudden Astonishment , that he wandered about a long time like one out of his Senses , looking for his Vineyard in the Vineyard itself ; but coming to himself , at length returned home , proclaiming ing his misfortune in such a Tone , and with such Expressions of Grief and Amazement , as raised at once both Pity and Laughter .	Nor was this the only effect occasioned by this thick Smoke ; for it is farther remarkable , that Silver and and Copper were changed black by it : And tho ' some People , who were forced to pass thro ' the Smoke in going to their Houses , assured me , that it had no very ill smell with it ; yet several of them were , that and the next Day after , troubled with great pains of their Head .	At this time the White Island , which ( as I have said before ) seemed to be above the Lesser Kammeni , and could be seen from the first Floor of the Houses in the Castle of Scaro , sunk down so low , that it could not be seen from the second .
ro5177	stink				like that of the Sink of a Ship						Next Morning I observed that the Island had been very much raised in the Night ; that a Range of Rocks about 50 Foot long was rose out of the Water , which made the Island broader than it was before ; and that the Sea was almost covered over with the reddish froathy Matter , above - mentioned .	This Matter , or Froth , appeared upon the Sea every time that the Island increased considerably ; and occasioned a stink , much like that of the Sink of a Ship : Which we may imagine to arise from a slimy Earth mixed with Sulphur , which being raised up with the Rocks , and coming to be washed off by the Waves , was loosened and diluted by the Water , and so so sent up to the Surface the Salts with which it was loaded .	The Fire had hitherto appeared but only in one place , upon the Top of the Black Island ; but on the 5th of September it made itself another Passage , and appeared at the End of that Island , on the side next Terasia , which is another Island which some Authors say was formerly joined to that of Santorini , and was separated from it by an Earthquake .

That kind , which at length obtained a place in the shops as the usnea of the ancients , was a species commonly found in our countries on old oaks and other trees , and is called by Dillenius ( 3 ) stringy tree - moss , or usnea of the shops .

The fibres passing directly forwards spread out under the orbital convolutions to end in the grey matter around the edge of this lobule , some of the more superficial turning into one or two of the gyri at its posterior and outer margin .

April 26 , It had some taste of the wood , and a small degree of ill smell , which being something more so on July 27 , it was then poured away .	June 15 , I put into an 18 gallon cask 18 ounces of unslacked stone - lime , made of very hard stone of the Clee - hills in Shropshire ; that is , in the proportion of four pounds and an half of lime to a hogshead of 72 gallons .

ro5234	smell				peculiar to the extract of Hemlock						On pouring some water on the residuum now moist , it was soon tinged of a brownish yellow , which being poured off , and a fresh quantity added at different times , until an ounce and a half of water had been used , there remained some blackish matter not soluble in water , which when dry weighed one grain , did not attract the moisture of the air , melted and burned with a bright flame when exposed to the fire , was soluble in spirit of wine , and had every characteristic of a rezin .	The tinged water , which had been separated from this rezin and filtered , was evaporated slowly , until a brown dry matter remained weighing three grains , which in a few hours attracted the moisture of the air , and relented into a dark brown thick liquour , of a saline taste , and the smell peculiar to the extract of Hemlock .	One drop of this liquor , diluted with a little water , destroyed the colour of ten times the quantity quantity of syrop of violets , without giving it the least red tint ; reducing it , on adding some drops of oleum tartari per deliquium , it suffered no remarkable change .

But with oil of vitriol there was a strong effervescence , without any sensible fume .	After exposure for about a quarter of an hour to bright sunshine , the colour of the chlorine had entirely disappeared ; the stopcock belonging to the globe , being turned in mercury recently boiled , a considerable absorption took place , just equal to one - half the volume of the mixture , and the residual gas possessed properties perfectly distinct from those belonging either to carbonic oxide or chlorine .

Its odour was different from that of chlorine , something like that which one might imagine would result from the smell of chlorine combined with that of ammonia , yet more intolerable and suffocating than chlorine itself , and affecting the eyes in a peculiar manner , producing a rapid flow of tears and occasioning painful sensations .	Its chemical properties were not less decidedly marked , than its physical ones .
ro5259	odour	it	perceptible								Mixcd with ammoniacal gas , a rapid condensation took place , a white salt was formed , and much heat was produced .	The compound of this gas and ammonia was a perfect neutral salt , neither changing the colour of turmeric or litmus ; it had no perceptible odour , but a pungent saline taste ; it was deliquescent , and of course very soluble in water ; it was decomposed by the sulphuric , nitric , and phosphoric acids , and also by liquid muriatic acid ; but it sublimed unaltered in the muriatic , carbonic , and sulphureous acid gasses , and dissolvedt without effervescing in acetic acid .	The products of its decomposition collected over mercury were found to be the carbonic and muriatic acid gasses ; and in the experiment with concentrated sulphuric acid when accurate results could be obtained , these two gasses were in such proportions , that the volume of the latter was double that of the former .
ro5259	odour	the gas|its|carbonic oxide	ofensive								I have ascertained by repeated trials , both synthetical and analytical , that the gas condenses four times its volume of the volatile alkali , and I have not been able to combine it with a smaller proportion .	Tin fused in the gas in a bent glass tube over mercury , by means of a spirit lamp , rapidly decomposed it ; the liquor of Libavius was formed ; and when the vessel had cooled , there was not the least change of the volume of the gas perceptible ; but the gas had entirely lost its ofensive odour , and was merely carbonic oxide ; for like carbonic oxide it burnt with a blue flame , afforded carbonic acid by its combustion , and was not absorbable by water .	The effects of zinc , antimony , and arsenic heated in the gas , were similar to those of tin ; compounds of these metals and chlorine were formed , and carbonic oxide in each experiment was liberated equal in volume to the gas decomposed .

The protoxide of antimony fused in the gas rapidly decomposed it ; the butter of antimony and the infusible peroxide were formed ; there was no change of the volume of the gas , and the residual gas was carbonic oxide .	Sulphur and phosphorus sublimed in the gas , produced no apparent change ; the volume of the gas was unaltered , and its characteristic smell was undiminished .

Mixed with hydrogene or oxygene singly , the gas was not inflamed by the electric spark , but mixed with both , in proper proportions , viz .
ro5259	odour	it|its	peculiar				to the spirit				But even this circumstance does not demonstrate that the gas has no affinity for lime , and is not capable of combining with it ; for on making a similar experiment with carbonic acid , substituting this gas for the new compound , the result was the same ; in two days only about one - tenth of a cubic inch was absorbed .	Though the gas is decomposed by water , yet it appears to I48 be absorbed unaltered by common spirits of wine , which contains so considerable a quantity of water ; it imparted its peculiar odour to the spirit , and its property of affecting the eyes ; five measures of the spirit condensed sixty measures of the gas .	It is also absorbed by the fuming liquor of arsenic , and by the oxymuriate of sulphur .

The liquor thus impregnated was thrown into water , and a pretty appearance was produced by the sudden escape of bubbles of the gas ; had not its intolerable smell convinced me that the gas was unaltered , I should not have conceived that it could pass through water undecomposed .	I cannot account for the assertion of MM .
ro5261	odour		agreeably fragrant								In making this experiment in the manner just described , and more especially when the tube is only dull red , the first portions of gas that reach the receiving gasometer , are obscured by a considerable quantity of vapour , which , however , afterwards disappeared .	To examine more particularly the cause of this phenomenon , I passed some pure olefiant gas , very slowly , through a red hot glass tube , about two feet in length , and containing in the heated part some pure and well burned charcoal : the gas was collected in a cold receiver , the sides of which became lined with a brown viscid substance of an agreeably fragrant odour , perfectly soluble in alcohol , and precipitated from this solution by water , which rendered it turbid , and of a whitish green hue .	This peculiar resinous matter appears to be a compound of hydrogen and carbon ; its vapour is perfectly decomposed by passing it through a highly heated platinum tube , hydrogen being evolved and carbon deposited .
ro5261	smell	of sulphuret of carbon				in the streets	I|I		in		The object in view was probably to get rid of the sulphuretted hydrogen ; but neither is this so to be attained .	In examining coal gas , I have often been struck with the formation of sulphurous acid during its combustion ; though when passed through solution of acetate of lead , it occasioned no blackening , a circumstance which led me to suspect the presence of some other sulphureous compound ; and I have often thought , in passing the open gas pipes in the streets , that I perceived the smell of sulphuret of carbon .	When sulphurous acid or sulphuretted hydrogen are passed with carburetted hydrogen through a red hot tube , a portion of carburet of sulphur is always formed , and the vapour of that highly volatile compound may well exist in the gas employed for illumination , which is always hurried through the condensers and gasometer .

When this happens , all the young men of the Kraal go in pursuit of him , directed by small dogs , who follow his scent : as soon as they discover him in the bushes , they irritate him , till he springs out with fury and attacks them ; when being all armed with hassagays , they often throw twenty or thirty into his body at once ; but it is common to lose a man or two in such attacks .	These Hottentots were all cloathed in crosses , or mantles , made of the hides of oxen , which they dress in a particular manner , making them as pliant as a piece of cloth : they wore the hairy side outwards .

We expressed great surprise at seeing such large flocks of sheep as he was possessed of subsist in such a desert ; on which he observed , that their sheep never ate any grass , only succulent plants , and all sorts of shrubs ; many of which were aromatic , and gave their flesh an excellent flavour .	Next day I passed through a large flock of sheep , where I saw them devouring the juicy leaves of mesembryanthemum , stapelia , cotyledon , and even the green seed vessels of euphorbia ; by eating such plants they require little water , especially in winter .

To these noxious qualities is superadded , as in the air of all rooms heated through the medium of cast - iron pipes or stoves , an offensive smell , arising partly from the partial combustion of animal and vegetable matters always floating in the atmosphere of a town , and perhaps also from minute impregnations of carbon , sulphur , phosphorus , or even arsenic , derived from the metal itself .	The Author expresses his surprise that in the recent report of the Parliamentary Committee on the subject of ventilation , no reference is made to the methods employed for that object in factories , although they afford the best models for imitation , being the results of innumerable exper ments made on a magnificent scale , with all the lights of science , and all the resources of the ablest engineers .
ro5327	smell	It							when rubbed		When rubbed pretty strongly on white paper , it leaves on it a faint black mark ; but not so readily as lead , or sulphuret of antimony .	It does not , when rubbed , - emit any smell .	When grossly powdered , the powder still retains the metallic lustre .
ro5327	smell	it							upon an iron not quite red hot		When grossly powdered , the powder still retains the metallic lustre .	When thrown , in the last mentioned state , upon an iron not quite red hot , it emits a phosphorescent light , of a bluish - white colour , but without any smell whatever ; no such light , however , can be obtained from it by means of friction .	Its specific gravity is 576 , 5 ; * it is consequently superior to that of sulphuret of copper , or sulphuret of antimony , but very inferior to that of sulphuret of lead .
ro5327	smell	of sulphureous acid	strong								The octaedral sulphuret of iron scratches it with great ease ; and , if we endeavour to obtain sparks from it , by means of a piece of steel , it is with great difficulty that any can be procured : it is also more brittle .	If grossly powdered , and thrown upon an iron heated to redness , although it then emits a strong smell of sulphureous acid , we do not perceive that inflammation of the uncombined sulphur which , as I have already said , takes place when the octaedral sulphuret of iron is treated in the same manner ; yet this last - mentioned kind of sulphuret , and that in striated cubes , are those which contain the smallest quantity of superabundant or uncombined sulphur .	The powder of the yellow double sulphuret , however , when thrown upon the hot ' iron , emits a fiery red light , similar to that which proceeds from the sulphuret of iron ; indeed its light is still more vivid .
ro5327	smell	This powder|of sulb phureous acid							when thrown upon an iron heated to		The colour ( a character of infinitely more consequence in metals than in stones ) of the firsts mentioned sulphuret is always abright deep yellow , whereas that of the other is a blackish gray ; this circumstance alone would be sufficient to create some doubts respecting the identity of these two substances , but their other characters also present very striking differences .	The gray sulphuret is harder : its powder , instead of being of a greenish - brown colour , like that of the yellow sulphuret , is black , This powder , when thrown upon an iron heated to redness , emits neither the smell of sulb phureous acid , nor the beautiful phosphorescent light of the other .	The specific gravity of the gray sulphuret , taken from crystals of a perfectly determinate form , was always found to be between 446o and 4560 , the mean being 4519 ; while that of the yellow double sulphuret is , as I have already stated , 4058 .
ro5334	smells	The Bark of this Tree	very agreeably						when fresh		The second Sort is called Canatte Coronde , that is , bitter and adstringent Cinnamon ; for the Ceylonese , in their Language , call Cinnamon in general Coronde , and Canatte signifies bitter and adstringent .	The Bark of this Tree comes off very easily , and smells very agreeably when fresh , but hath a bitter Taste .	It is an Advantage to us , that it doth not grow in great Plenty hereabouts , because else one might easily mistake it for a better ; as indeed , in general , it requires a good deal of Skill and Attention so to distinguish the Cinnamon Trees from each other , as not to choose now and then a worse Sort for the best .

The third Sort is called by the Ceylonese , Capperoe Coronde , which is as much as to say , Camphorated Cinnamon , because it hath a very strong Smell and Taste of Camphire .	It grows plentifully enough in the Island , but not in the Eastern Parts of it : However , they find Means now and then to send it over privately , and sell it to the Danes and English , who come to Trade upon the Coasts of Cormandel ; for as long as there is but one Port in the Island left open , abundance of this sort of bad Merchandise may be exported .

It hath otherwise but little Taste , and an ungrateful Smell ; but the Colour of it is very fine , and it is not many Years since I first took Notice , that the Natives , who are all Blacks , mix a good deal of this mucilaginous Cinnamon along with the first and best Sort , the Colour of both being very much alike , excepting only , that in the good Sort there are some few yellowish Spots appear towards the Extremities .	The sixth Sort is called by the Natives Nieke Coronde , the Tree which bears it , having a good deal of Resemblance to another Tree , which is by them called Nieke Gas , and the Fruit it bears Nieke .

The Bark of this sort of Cinnamon Tree , hath no manner of Taste or Smell , when taken off , and is made use of by the Natives only in Physic .	For by roasting of it they obtain a Water and Oil , which they anoint themselves withal , thinking thereby to keep off all sorts of noxious Fumes , and Infections in the Air .

For by roasting of it they obtain a Water and Oil , which they anoint themselves withal , thinking thereby to keep off all sorts of noxious Fumes , and Infections in the Air .	They likewise express a Juice out of the Leaves of it , which they say cools and strengthens the Brain , if the Head be rubbed with it .
ro5334	Smell	of Cinnamon		Bark							The eighth Sort is called Catte - Coronde , that is , the thorny or prickly Cinnamon ; Cat , in the Ceylonese Language , is a Thorn , or Prickle ; accordingly this Tree is very prickly .	The Bark is in some Measure like Cinnamon , but the Leaves differ very much , and the Bark it self hath nothing either of the Taste or Smell of Cinnamon .	The Natives use the Root , Bark and Leaves of this Tree in Physic , applying them in Form of Cataplasms , to Tumours and Swellings from a thick corrupt Blood , which they say it cures in a short Time .
ro5334	smells				like Camphire						All the several sorts of Cinnamon Trees , the best as well as the rest , must grow a certain Number of Years , before the Bark is fit to be taken off : With this Difference however , that some of the Trees of the same sort , as for Instance of the first and best , will ripen two or three Years sooner than others , which is owing to the Difference of the Soil they grow in ; those for In2 stance , stance , which grow in Vallies , where the Ground is a fine whitish Sand ( and there are many such Vallies in the Island of Ceylon ) will in five Years Time be fit to have the Bark taken off : Others on the contrary , which stand in a wet slimy Soil , must have seven or eight Years Time to grow , before they are ripe enough .	Again , those Trees are later , which grow in the Shade of other larger Trees , whereby the Sun is kept from their Roots : And hence also it is , that the Bark of such Trees hath not that Sweetness and agreeable Taste observable in the Bark of those Trees which grow in a white Sandy Ground , where with little Wet they stand full exposed to the Sun , but is rather of a bitterish Taste , something adstringent , and smells like Camphire .	For by the Heat of the Sun ' s Rays the Camphire is made so thin and volatile , that it rises up and mixes with the Juices of the Tree , where it undergoes a small Fermentation , and then rising still higher between the Substance of the Wood , and the thin inner Membrane of the Bark , it is at last so effectually diffused through the Branches and Leaves , that there is not the least Footstep of it to be perceived any where .
ro5334	Smell	its									On the contrary , if you taste the inner Membrane of the Bark , when fresh taken off , you ' ll find it a most exquisite Sweetness , extremely agreeable to the Taste , whereas the outward Part of the Bark differs but very little in Taste from the common Trees ; which shows plainly that all the Sweetness of it is owing only to the inner Membrane .	But when the Bark is laid in the Sun in order to its being dried and wound up , this Oily and agreeable Sweetness of the inner Membrane communicates and diffuses it self also throughout the whole outward Part of it ( which however hath been first stripped , when as yet upon the Tree , of its outermost greenish Coat ) and imbues it so strongly , as to make the Bark a Commodity , which for the Fragrancy of its Smell , and the Sweetness of its Taste , is coveted all over the World .	It may not be amiss to take Notice also , how many Years the Cinnamon Trees , when they are once come to a full Maturity , will continue in that State , so that the Bark , when taken off , shall have lost nothing of its Sweetness and Virtue .

However he permits his Subjects to express the Juice out of another Fruit , not unlike the Fruit of the Cinnamon Tree ; but this Juice being only a thin fat Substance , like Oil of Olives , they cannot burn it any otherwise but in Lamps .

By this means upwards of 135 grains of water were condensed in the cylinder , which had no taste nor smell , and which left no sensible sediment when evaporated to dryness ; neither did it yield any pungent smell during the evaporation ; in short , it seemed pure water .	In my first experiment , the cylinder near that part where the air was fired was a little tinged with sooty matter , but very slightly so ; and that little seemed to proceed from the putty with which the apparatus was luted , and which was heated by the flame ; for in another experiment , in which it was contrived so that the luting should not be much heated , scarce any sooty tinge could be perceived .

When purified by rectification in an atmosphere of carbonic acid , zincethyl possesses the following properties : - At ordinary temperatures it is a colourless , transparent and mobile liquid , refracting light strongly and possessinrg a peculiar odour , rather pleasant than otherwise , and therefore differing greatly from that of zinemethyl .	Its specific gravity is 1P182 at 180 C .

Carefully dried flowers of sulphur have only a slight action upon an ethereal solution of zincethyl , but the applicatio - n of a gentle heat suffices to produce a brisk reaction ; the sulphur gradually disappears , a white flocculent precipitate is formed , and a strong odour of sulphide of ethyl developed .	The chief product of this reaction is the double sulphide of ethyl and zinc ( niercaptide of zinc ) , which is produced as follows : C4HU Zn } = C H1 S + ZnS .

I will only add in reference to the spathose calcareous constituent , that its microscopic str ' ucture proves it to be an original formation , deposited in mnembranous cellular moulds , under the influence of the vital organizing forces , and not to be the result of post - mortem infiltration of mineral substance , into an oiiginally light and porous , or cellular texture , as WALCH , PARKINSON , LAMARCK and DE BLAINVILLE ? have conjectured .

After this he considers Cold , Sound , Meteors , Water , Odors , Sapors , the Flux and Reflux of Waters , presenting withal his Hypothesis of Tides , and assigning certain Criteria , to try its truth by ; which done , he goes on to treat of the Earth , and of what is contained in the Bowels thereof ; handling also of Dryness , Consistence , Magnetisme , and Electricity : Further he shows himself a great Favorer to the Rest of the Earth ; and having taken great pains to assort the same how successfully , good Astronomers may judge ) he passes on to discourse of Vegetables ; then of the Celestial Bodies , and among them of Comets , which he supposes to be made up of the Ethereal Effluvia of the Luminaries , or the Confluvia of the Ethereal matter ; as Aereal Meteors are made of Vapors .	Further , he discourses of the Formation of Fishes and Fowls ; then , of Sensation , Imagination , Appetite ; Beasts , Man , Human Body , Human Body , Human Spirit , the image of God in Man , and the Immortality of the Human Soul : where he represents Man as the Centrick Orb of the whole World , making him the Abstract thereof , and that one Nature , which all other Creatures do circumferentially respect , relating to him one way or another , as so many lines in a Circle to the Center .

TO this Treatise is prefixed an Epistle of Doctor Thomas Bartholin concerning this very Book and Argument ; by which it appears , that this Author is not contented with Aristotle to enquire , Why bitter or strong - sented Medicaments and Plants do mostly purge , and fragrant ones provoke to urine ; nor with Galen , to find out their Virtues by the Colour , Smell and Taste , but proceeds to particular Experiments , and examines also , How and upon what account the Virtues of Plants are discoverable by the Smell and Taste ; descending to the consideration of the several Particles , Figures , and Pores , upon which the diversity of those Sensations depends ; and super - adding the Experiments of sober Chymists , and the Principles of the Cartesian Philosophy , to those of Aristotle and Galen .	Mean while the Learned Bartholin commends very much the knowledge and use of simple Native Medicins , especially prepared of Domestique Plants , and directs to such at home , as may perform the part of Exoticks .

THis Book came but very lately to our view ; And that the extravagant Name of its Subject may not take off sober men from considering it , we shall at the very first tell them , that by this affected word of Lac Lunae nothing else is meant here , than Flores Argenti , or a fine white porous and friable Earth , insipid and without scent , dissoluble in water , and tinging it with a milky colour , and sometimes raising a kind of ebullition in it ; found commonly in Silver - Mines , and in them sublimed and sticking to the roofs of the rocky Hills ; having a drying and abstersive quality , and therefore good against the afflux of sharp humors in ulcerated parts ; serving also for an excellent consmetick .	All which particulars are at large deduced and discoursed upon by the Author ; who observes , first , That Gesner in his Book of Fossils takes good notice of this Mineral Earth ; and affirms it to be found in the Mountains of Helvetia , especially that , which is called Mount Pilat .

His Physicians sent him into the Country whence he came , where in about a twelvemonth I heard he dyed , but was not acquainted with his circumstances after : What success the operation we practised on Mrs Terry would have had on this Boy , I dare not determine ; tho I cannot but think it might have been safely done to him and another Patient I was since called to , but I could not obtain the consent of the ~ that was consulted .
ro5418	smelling	few	strongly	vapour	of sulphurous acid						200 grains more of oil of wine were treated in the same way , but instead of evaporating the baryta solution , it was precipitated by carbonate of potash ; the potash solution evaporated at a temperature of i50o until it crystallized , remained perfectly neutral ; the crystals were thin plates , not unlike chlorate of potash , greasy to the touch , very soluble in water and alcohol , burning when heated with a flame like that of ether , and leaving an acid sulphate of potash .	A few grains of these crystals were heated in a tube , when they fused , swelled up , and gave off a dense white vapour , which condensed into an ol - like fluid , smelling strongly of sulphurous acid ; the residuary salt was an acid sulphate of potash .	The following experiments were now undertaken with a view of more accurately determining the composition of this crystalline salt , 20 grains of the crystals being heated to redness , left io , 56 grains of sulphate of potassa , equal to 4 , 8 sulphuric acid , 5 , 76 potash .

ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The spinal cord passes out behind the posterior margin of the basioccipital .	The olfactory nerves leave the skull on each side of the ethmovomerine division of the craniofacial axis .	The walls of the cranial cavity are formed by a number of bones , which are divisible into two series , a superior and a lateral .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								Most important relations exist between the contents of the cranium and these constituent elements of its walls .	"The par vagum makes it exit between the exoccipital and the petromastoid ; the portio dura and portio mollis enter the petromastoid ; the third division of the trigeminal passes through the large "" foramen ovale , "" which , in the sheep , has the exceptional peculiarity of being situated nearly in the middle of the alisphenoid ; the optic nerve passes through a foramen included between the orbitoand pre - sphenoids , while , as has been mentioned above , the olfactory nerve passes out beside the ethmoid and in front of the orbitosphenoid ."	The relation of the pituitary body , or hypophysis cerebri , to the upper surface of the basisphenoid , has already been alluded to ; it , of course , gives more or less nearly the position of the third ventricle and crura cerebri .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The latter is connected above with the bony plates representing the orbitosphenoids .	The former exhibits on each side , posteriorly and superiorly , a groove , in which the olfactory nerve rests and , above this , expands into an arched process , which supports the anterior extremity of the frontal bone .	Anteriorly , the superior end of the bone widens into a rhomboidal plate , which appears externally between the nasal bones .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory	the orbito - sphenoids	olfactory|olfactory								Behind them the lateral walls of the skull are formed by the alisphenoid .	These bones have the same essential relations as in the bird , for the olfactory nerves pass out of the skull over , and in front of , the orbito - sphenoids ; the optic nerves make their exit behind and beneath these and the alisphenoid , while the trigeminal makes its exit behind the posterior edge of the alisphenoid .	When viewed from within , the foramen ovale is seen to be as in the bird , a mere conjugational foramen between the alisphenoid and the bone which follows it ; and on an external view , the third division of the trigeminal is seen to pass entirely in front of the last - named bone .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								In fact the pituitary body may be regarded as marking the organic centre , as it were , of the skull - its relations to the axial cranial bones being the same , as far as I am aware , in all Vertebrata .	The olfactory nerves pass on either side of the ethmoid , which bounds the cranial cavity in front , the greater part of its substance and that of the vomer being outside the cranial cavity .	5 .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The apertures whereby the cranial nerves make their exit are situated in the side - walls of the capsule , that for the vagus lying immediately behind the auditory capsule , while that for the trigeminal is immediately in front of the same organ .	The olfactory nerves perforate the anterior walls of the cranial capsule ; the optic , its lateral walls between them and the trigeminal .	The skulls of the Elasmobranchii , again , appear at first to be something quite different from either of these .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The skulls of the Elasmobranchii , again , appear at first to be something quite different from either of these .	The cranium is here a cartilaginous box , more or less incomplete and membranous above , and presenting on each side posteriorly a transverse enlargement , in which the auditory organ is contained ; while anteriorly it expands into a broad plate , which on each side overhangs the olfactory sacs .	The notochord and the membranous space have disappeared , or their traces only are visible in the base of the cranium , whose walls are , as it were , crusted with a multitude of minute plates of bone .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory	capsule	olfactory|olfactory								The inferior arc of the hyoid is constant ( except in the Pharynyobranchii ) , and has always , speaking broadly , the same relative position with respect to the auditory capsule and the posterior crus of the suborbitar arch .	The suborbitar arch itself is always present ( except in Pharyngobranchii ) ; its posterior crus is always attached to the cranium behind the third division of the trigeminal nerve , while the anterior is invariably fixed to that part of the skull which lies behind , or beside , the base of the olfactory capsule .	Thus the employment of the method of gradation alone exhibits a surprising uniformity in the organization of these lower forms of skull ; and on comparing them with the higher forms , it seems obvious that , so far as it goes , their plan is identical with that of the latter ; for the relations of the auditory organ to the par vagum and trige * See Note IV .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory|olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory|olfactory|olfactory								If the skull of the larval frog just described , be laid open and the exit of the nerves observed ( fig .	9 ) , it will be seen that the par vagum makes its way out by a foramen situated immediately behind the auditory capsule ; that the third division of the trigeminal leaves the cranium in front of the auditory capsule , passing over the posterior crus of the palatosuspensorial arch ; and that the optic traverses the membranous walls of the skull between this and the olfactory nerve , which perforates the anterolateral region to enter the olfactory capsules .	The latter are situated wide apart , on each side and in front of , the broad ethmo - presphenoidal cartilage and the anterior crus of the palatosuspensorial arch , and are even a little overlapped by the edges of the ethmovomerine processes .
ro5459	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								A histological metamorphosis into cartilage is undergone by the roof of the occipital region of the skull , but in front of this it remains membranous ; so that in the adult frog ( in which this cartilaginous framework persists ) , the skull , when deprived of its bony matter , presents an anterior fontanelle .	The ethmovomerine cartilages diverge still more , and form the broad mass whose lateral cavities shelter the olfactory sacs in the adult frog .	If , bearing in mind the changes which are undergone by the palatosuspensorial apparatus , and which have already been described , we now compare the stages of development of the frog ' s skull with the persistent conditions of the skull in the Amphioxus , the Lamprey , and the Shark , we shall discover the model and type of the latter in the former .

The discharge from the wound was increased ; it had stained the bandage of a deep reddish - brown colour , and was of a disagreeable smell .

When I came to loosen the bandage , I was greatly surprised to find it daubed all over with the discharge ; but , as soon as the dressing was removed , there was no evidence wanting to assure me , that this discharge was in part faecal , not only from the colour and smell of it , but likewise from the sharp pain it had occasioned in passing through the wound .	My hopes of his recovery now began to fail me ; however , I resolved to persevere , and act as though I was sure of success .

It also contains bromine , and has a very pungent smell , which affects the eyes and nose very strongly , occasioning considerable pain .

When heated in a test tube , it emits an agreeable smell and yields a white crystalline sublimate .	Though orcin is always found in the mother - liquors from which the evernesic acid has been obtained , yet when evernesic acid itself is boiled a second time with either potash or baryta , no orcin is produced , showing that the orcin has been derived solely from the decomposition of evernic acid .

That day he was better till night , when he grew very feverish .

The bromide of ethylene does not , indeed , decompose the hydrated peroxide of barium ; but this peroxide is immediately acted on by the diacetate , and a solution is formed of a most pungent odour , containing no peroxide of hydrogen , but possessing the usual characteristics of the organic peroxides .	I have not made many experiments with the compound ammonias .

All they could say of the former was , that it was very hot , very foul , and as it were greasy ; that it boils up in many places , and has a very offensive smell : and the latter remarkable only for the saline appearances above described .	That country , however , in general , produces considerable quantities of iron , copper , and sulphur .

The Observation of the Vespae Ichneumones , as it hath relation to Spiders , I willingly reserve for other Papers : yet I may tell you in general , that this kind of Insect is one of the greatest puzzels in nature ; there being few Excrescencies of Plants , and very many births of Insects , wherein these slender Wasps after divers strange ways are concerned .

The presence of a minute amount of moisture in the materials employed gives rise to a number of secondary products , the chief of which are , cyanide and carbonate of ammoniurn , and a gas possessing a highly offensive odour , which imparts to the distillate a smell not at all due to the nitrile itself .	By far the most advantageous method of preparing acetonitrile consists in acting upon acetamide with anhydrous phosphoric acid , as proposed by M .

Pure acetonitrile possesses an ethereal odour , faintly recalling that of cyanogen ; its aromatic taste is pungent , but not disagreeable .	We observed the boiling - point 77 ? - 78 ? , which coincides with that observed by DUMAS .
ro5571	odour	of acetonitrile									It does not appear to have been previously noticed , that acetonitrile burns with a luminous flame , the edges of which are beautifully tinged with peach - blossom colour .	The flame and odour of acetonitrile unmistakeably bespeak the cyanic relations of this compound .	This body , when mixed with its own volume of fuming sulphuric acid , gives rise to a very energetic reaction , a considerable amount of heat being evolved , which causes much of the nitrile to volatilize and thus escape decomposition .
ro5571	odour		highly offensive								The formation of cyanide of ethyl ( propionitrile ) by means of cyanide and sulphovinate of potassium , has all the disadvantages above enumerated in the case of cyanide of methyl .	A large quantity of an inflammable gas of a highly offensive odour is disengaged , the annoyance of which may be avoided by conducting the gas from the receiver of the liquid into the cylinder of a wire gauze burner , in the air - flame of which it is perfectly consumed .	In the preparation of cyanide of ethyl by means of cyanide and sulphovinate of potassium , through the intervention of unavoidable moisture , a variety of different reactions appear to proceed side by side .
ro5571	smell		most insupportable prussic								Cyanide of ammonium is likewise invariably present , prussic acid being generated by the action of water upon the cyanide of potassium , while alcohol is reproduced to a very considerable extent .	Lastly , this process gives rise to a most remarkable body with a most insupportable prussic smell , the formation of which we have traced in a great variety of reactions .	We have not completed the study of this compound .

In which latter part , having waved the Aristotelian doctrine of this point , nor found a full satisfaction in that of the vulgar Chymists , he closes with that ancient Hypothesis , which imports , that Stones and all other Sublunary Bodies are made of Water condensed by the power of Seeds , which by the virtue of their fermentive Odours perform these transmutations upon Matter .	For the better understanding of which he premises someGenerals , and then descends to particular proofs of what he asserts : concerning which we can do no better than to remit the Reader to the Author himself .
ro5579	fumes|fumes|smell		a peculiarly disagreeable	fumes|fumes							For this purpose I made a solution of ammonia , cooled it by a mixture of ice and muriate of lime , and slowly passed into it chlorine , cooled by the same means .

Its smell is very nauseous , strongly resembling that of the combination of carbonic oxide and chlorine , discovered by my brother ; and its effect on the eyes is peculiarly pungent and distressing .	A little of it was introduced under water into the receiver of an air pump , and the receiver exhausted ; it became an elastic fluid , and in its gaseous state was rapidly absorbed or decomposed by the water .

The arsenic is also readily removed by exposing the foil to the moderate heat of a spirit lamp , .	when it rises in the form of arsenious acid ; but previous to this effect , the alliaceous , or garlick - like odour , so characteristic of this metal , is strongly produced * , and the surface of the platina remains unaltered .

But this is very far from conveying a just idea of the degree to which this mode of detection may be carried : for a single drop of the aqueous arsenious acid would have afforded ample evidence of the arsenic as it respected colour , insolubility in muriatic and sulphuric acids , alliaceous odour , and volatility ; which would give the a oth part of a grain .	Even this very minute quantity gives us by no means the extreme limits to which this truly microscopic method of detecting metals may be carried .

The crucible was now filled with pure water , and numerous steel - grey coloured filaments of metallic arsenic floated on the surface ; some being collected on a slip of platina and heated , the alliaceous odour was strongly produced , and they were dissipated in a white vapour .	The crucible being washed , and a few drops of diluted muriatic acid put into it , it was rinsed in pure water and dried , when its gold surface was so completely coated with arsenic of a dark steel - grey colour , that no vestige of the gold at the bottom of the crucible could be seen , even with the aid of a magnifying glass , though the surface was full of little inequalities .

ro5584	odour		alliaceous								Thus the partial oxidation of the surface exhibited in variegated colours ; the strong cohesion of the arsenic to the platina , are characteristics of the metal .	The alliaceous odour ( in cases where no deoxygenating substance can be presumed to exist ) is admitted to belong only to the metal ; insolubility in strong muriatic acid , is a property of no 154 known oxide of arsenic , but of the metal .	To which may be added the facts , that I have repeatedly coated the arsenic , deposited on platina , with copper , and also with mercury ; and removed both , without affecting the arsenic .

This Shrub is less in all its Parts in Arabia , and to the South of Persia , because in those Countries it rains seldom ; but , in Recompense , its Flowers have much more Smell than in Malabar .	It must be remarked here upon this Occasion , that the Description just now given , and which contains the Size of the Parts , was made in a Garden in the Persian Gulf belonging to the Dutch Factory , and situate about a League from the Town of Gameroon , otherwise called Bender - Abassi , where there was one of these Trees carefully preserved , which was the first I saw in the Indies ; as it was complete in all its Parts , having Flowers and Fruit ; and as it appeared to me agreeable and curious , especially on account of the fine Smell of the Flowers , and as it was a new Genus to be established in Botany , I examined it with great Exactness , and noted its Characters , Figures , and Dimensions .

Our Author contents himself with saying , that the Persians and Arabians , who appear to have been anciently the first that used this Plant , frequently use at present not only its Flowers to perfume their Linen , their Cloaths , and their Tables , but make a greater Use of its Leaves in a Decoction , for the Cure of all Distempers of the Skin , as the Itch , Scabs , and Ring - worm , which the Air of their Country causes from its Heat , and from the Drought which often reigns there to a great Degree .	These Disorders , if they are neglected to be cured as soon as possible in dry Climates , easily degenerate into the Leprosy ; and it is on account of these Disorders of the Skin , that the eating of Pork is forbidden to People of every Religion in these Countries ; because that Food there is known to occasion these Distempers .

This cannot be used inwardly , it being nauseous beyond Expression : It smells somewhat like rotten Eggs , but much worse .	But , used by way of Bath , it may cleanse the Skin of all Foulnesses , purge and deterge the cutaneous Glands from all foul noxious Humours : It may reinforce the natural Heat and Vigour , ( where they are decayed ) and may restore the impaired Digestions : And hence , finally , it may promote Virility in Men , and Fecundity in Women .

As this Plant is frequent so near us , and as its Appearance and Smell are so like Smallage and Celeri , we are greatly interested that the Knowledge of it be extended as much as possible .	As I find no good Representation thereof among Authors , and as a good Figure conveys a stronger Idea to the Generality of Readers than the most accurate Description , I have procured that admirable Artist Mr .

He examines 18 Ounces of the Gall of an Ox , from which he obtains 16 Ounces of clear water by Distillation , of a stinking Oil , and half an ounce of a salt Earth , in which he says there is a Sal Acidum : so that he would ascribe Inflammability to belong rather to the Acidum then Oleosum .	He examines blood also , from whence his Antagonist may argue , namely that the Oil in the blood , gives the natural heat to the body ; but he will ascribe more to the salt : for he says , that in case blood be gently evaporated ad siccitatem , and then exposed to the Air , a certain salt , of a Nitrous Nature , will grow upon it : by this you may see the salt to predominate , in case you edulcorate this dried blood by frequent ablutions with water , and then distill the mentioned exsiccatK 2 ed ed Mass , you shall have much less Oil : from whence we may learn , that Oils are the most subtle parts of bodies ; and may also conclude , that nothing is to be found without salt ; or that bodies are set together , and compounded with salt .

To the last , which says all Acida are Volatilia , because of an odor or sent that rises from them : he denys that all do give an odor , and instances in Oleum Vitrioli , that gives none ; and by consequence no Acida pura afford it , but such as are mixed with an Urinose salt .	He pretends to know a method how to reduce spirit of Wine , to water , by separating its salt , with the help of salt of Tartar .

The acid did not act upon the alcohol so ; immediatelyas when these fluids are alone mixed together , but first gradually dissolved the oxide : however , after some minutes had elapsed , a smell of ether was perceptible , and a white dense smoke , much : yegetable alkali .	- The white ^ precipitate , well washed and dried , produced a fulmi .

That the determinations of the will are , as it were , intercepted , and prevented from reaching certain parts of the body , by the means of Ganglions , may be farther inferred by considering , that all nerves , which have a ready communication with the soul , either by affecting it with perceptions , or conveying its commands , have no Ganglions : These are never found upon the olfactory , optic , or auditory nerves , any more than upon the nerves and instruments in voluntary motion .	For we may well imagine the same mechanism , which prevents the will from extending its control to some muscles , placed upon a sensory nerve , would have equally hindered the conveyance of any sensible impression to the mind .

The Cartrages contain a pap or batter , of the consistence of a Gelly , or something thicker ; of a middle colour between Syrup of Violets and the Conserve of red Roses ; of an acid taste , and unpleasant smell .	In each of these , at the Concave end there lies one Bee - maggot , which feeds upon the forementioned matter , till it grows to its full bigness , and then makes , and encloses her self in , a Theca or husk , of a dark red colour , and oval Figure ; in which she is changed into a Bee .

This substance resembles spermaceti in its consistence between the teeth , but has neither taste nor smell ; it melts in a small heat and when congealed againR becvlnes more solid and looks like wax ; ill a greater heat it burns , and emits a strong animal smell .	As I never l - leard or perceived that the water in which this bird lay has any particulgr property , I am lnclined to think that it has undergone this singular change while buried in the mud , and that the brook had afterwards washed it up , and carried it into this pool .
ro5737	vapour	of the substance									I soon ascertained that the fluid was not water , as it congealed and became opaque at a temperature of 56 ? .	When the crystal was pierced under distilled water , the water rushed in and entirely filled the cavity , so that no other aeriform matter but the vapour of the substance could have been present ; the water was rendered white and cloudy , apparently by the substance .	I endeavoured to collect some of it for chemical examination , but it was too small in quantity ( not equalling in volume 6 of the volume of the cavity , ) to be submitted to analysis .

It swam on the water , had no distinct taste , but a smell resembling naphtha ; a portion of it taken out mixed with the water , when exposed to heat acted like fixed oil , and it seemed to have a high temperature of ebullition .	It inflamed , producing a white smoke .

There were also found some Birds nests of a prodigious greatness , so that Six Men could not , by stretching out their Arms , encompass One of them ; but the Fowls were not to be found .

It has no smell when breathed upon ; it has not any taste , nor does it adhere to the tongue till it has been strongly ignited .	It does not become electrical , or phosphorescent , by heat or friction ; nor does it decrepitate before the blowpipe , but loses its hardness , and becomes quite opake .
ro5764	smell		slightly empyreumatic								It now had lost more than one - fourth of its weight , and adhered strongly to the tongue ; neither water nor alcohol had any effect on this mineral .	When exposed , in a glass tube , to a heat of from 212 ? to 600 ? , it gave out an elastic vapour , which , when condensed , was a clear fluid , having a slightly empyreumatic smell , but not differing in taste from pure water .	The solution of this substance in sulphuric acid produced crystals in thin plates , which had the properties of sulphate of alumine , and from which , when re - dissolved and mixed with potash , octahedral crystals of alum were obtained .
ro5773	smell		very offensive sulphurous						during combustion		The lignite was formerly used in large quantities in an adjoining pottery ; at present but little is employed there , and its use is almost entirely confined to the poorer cottagers of the immediate district .	A very offensive sulphurous smell , which it emits during combustion , prevents its general domestic use .	The refuse matter , consisting of clay and waste or valueless lignite , is lodged on the surface around the pit .
ro5773	odour		very offensive								Iron - pyrites occurs in it in considerable quantities ; and spontaneous combustion is common in fresh refuse , especially after much rain .	The fire is not generally visible near the surface in the day - time , but its presence is indicated by smoke and the very offensive odour previously mentioned .	Cracks , having their sides lined with flowers of sulphur , cross the burning mass in various directions .

Dalesme Enginier , prosecuting his discoveries , has found out a Machine , which tho ' very little and portable , consumes all the Smoke of all sorts of Wood whatsoever , and that so , that the most curious eye cannot discover it in the Room , nor the nicest Nose smell it , altho ' the Fire be perfectly open .	This has given such satisfaction to all that have seen it , and to the King himself , that he has caused the Experiment to be made several times before Him .

In frosty weather , I have often found stalactites hanging round the edges of the bason , which , upon examination , were formed by the selenites impregnated with the vitriol of iron , changing their white appearance to a rusty yellow - colored crust covering the stalactites .

The Flesh of this last was grown very black , and there was much extravasated Lymph between it and the Skin , which stunk insufferably ; but I could not perceive , that the Viscera were at all discoloured .	July 4th , We had another Fowl , half grown , bit ~ in two Places , and the Medicine was applied : Half an Hour after which , the Fowl eat Meat , and seemed much recovered , but was dead in fourteen Hours Time .
ro5817	Smell	of the Medicine									Two Vipers were tried upon the Man , but neither would bite him : One of them attempted it several times , and spilt his Venom , but always caught back his Head again , as if there had been something in the Hand offensive .	Upon this , suspecting that the Smell of the Medicine might occasion it , we made him wash his Hand , after which another Viper bit him immediately : But whether our Conjecture was right or not , must depend upon farther Trial .	The Man received the Bite upon the Joint of the Thumb , and the Blood issued at the two Orifices .
ro5835	smelling	of Sulphur	strong								There are some Lakes , which , our Author informs us , in the Memory of Man , contained only fresh Water , but are now very salt .	One of this kind , about 40 Years ago , abounded with fresh Water Fish , but is now become salt , smelling strong of Sulphur , with a bitter Taste , and all the Fish are killed .	The Inhabitants assured our Author , that some fresh - water Lakes have been by degrees dried up , and that others have appeared , where formerly it was dry Ground ; and that even some of these newformed Lakes , which at first had no Fish in them , are now very plentifully stocked .
ro5835	Smell		sulphureous								Three other such Places occur within the Circuit of eighty Leagues .	The Provinces beyond the Lake Baical are mountainous , with high and wide - extended Plains lying betwixt them , which in many Places are only covered with barren Sand ; so that in some Places one may travel thro ' such Deserts one , two , or three Days together , without finding Wood enough to make a Fire , or any other Water than that of salt Springs , which are very frequent ; and being dried up by the Summer - Heats , leave a saline Crust , very much resembling Natron , being of an alcaline Nature , with a sulphureous Smell .	The Country that borders on the Rivers Uruncan and Gasimur is extremely rich and fruitful .
ro5835	Effluvia		poisonous								The Face of the Country is delightful , and its Produce to the Husbandman almost exceeding his Hopes : But what renders it still more surprising , is , that a Country , whose Soil yields to few in Fertility , and the Beauty of its Bloom , should yet cover immense Riches in its Bosom .	Here are Mines of Gold and Silver , which have long been worked to Advantage : The Veins are rich , and lie shallow ; yet communicate no poisonous Effluvia to the Vegetables that cover them : Nor do those distinguishing Marks of Sterility appear here , which in most other mining Countries are so observable .

ro5838	smell	it	medicinal		resembling somewhat that of Valer ' ian						In June 1852 , a sample of urine , freely exposed to the air in an open vessel , was observed after four or five days ' exposure , gradually to change colour ; the pellicle or scum which had formed upon the surface of the urine became first slate - coloured , and at length deep blue , with here and there a rusty - red tint .	T ' he urine also underwent at the same time some remarkable changes ; it became thick and turbid , deep brown , greenish , bluish - green , and finally of a faded yellowish - green colour ; a considerable sediment was found at the bottom of the glass ; this was deep brown , intermixed with a little blue colouring matter , and it had a medicinal smell resembling somewhat that of Valer ' ian .	In this state , without undergoing any further material changes , the urine remained for many days .
ro5838	odour	leucine|the product	powerful		which was somewhat like valerianic acid				on being treated with hydrochloric acid		A portion of the alcoholic extract was heated with Liq .	Potasse for the purpose of ascertaining whether it contained leucine , and the product , on being treated with hydrochloric acid , gave off a powerful odour , which was somewhat like valerianic acid ; but the result was too doubtful to be of much value .	The author had already referred to the peculiar smell of Valerian emitted by the extractive of more than one of the samples .

It is very true that many of them in going up could not be seen , on account of the dark smoke ; but when they returned from the smoky heat , they showed plainly where they had been by their strong smell of fetid sulphur , just like stones that have been thrown out of a mortar , and have passed through the smoke of inflamed gunpowder .	The mud was of the colour of ashes , and at first very liquid , then by degrees less so , and in such quantities , that in less than twelve hours , with the help of the abovementioned stones , a mountain was raised of a thousand paces in height .

The Alps contain about 500 Species peculiar to themselves , all diverse , perennial most of them , biting , scented , and frequently with a white Flower ; besides many Plants common to other Places .	The Author then proceeds to enumerate all the Botanists , who by their Journals and Publications have laboured to oblige the World with Histories and Descriptions of the almost inexhaustible Number of Plants , which the various Soil and Situation of this Country produces ; and after having mentioned the Performances of these great Men , he gives some Account of his own Travels , and the Progress of his botanical Studies ; that he had gone through Germany , Holland , France , and England , and made very few Observations of the botanic kind , at least had preserved no Specimens of what he had seen ; but upon his Arrival at Basil to attend the Lectures of Bernoulli , and study Mathematics there , he was seized , as it were , by the Genius of the Place , where those great Writers the Bauhins had lived , and were public Professors ; and whose Chair at that Time was very worthily filled by Starhelinus : That he began to collect , describe , and compile , with so great Hopes of Success , however remote , that he even attempted the Work before us , at a time when he was scarcely acquainted with the more common Plants .
ro5855	smell	the bird	disagreeable						has been some time dead		The feet and bill may be varnished over with the same sort of varnish that is used for the preservation .	The bird must then stand for a day or two in an airy place for the varnish to penetrate and fix ; and lastly , the bird must be baked in an oven , it is not absolutely necessary , but as it makes them dry , and finishes the preservation immediately : moreover if the bird has been some time dead and has any disagreeable smell , this method makes it perfectly sweet ; but care must be taken not to put them into the oven while it is too hot , as it would blister the bill and nails .	The best rule to know when the oven has a proper degree of heat is this : while the oven is cooling , throw in now and then a tail feather taken from any fowl , which must be placed about the middle of the oven .
ro5857	smell		very sulphurous								Our new room in the fort , though as strong as bricks and chunam could make it , is shivered on all sides from bottom to top ; and the old building equally cracked is in great part tumbled down .	The ground opened in several places in the town , throwing up water of a very sulphurous smell ; and several ditches and tanks were filled up , which are now level dry land .	The emotions were so complicated , that we could not well determine their direction ; being sometimes from west to east , and again from east to west ; and the tanks in some places overflowed north and south .
ro5862	odour		fetid sulphureous			in Talcahuano					One , in shape like a lofty tower , occurred in the offing ; the other took place in the small bay of San Vicente , and after it had disappeared , a whirlpool succeeded , hollow , in shape like an inverted cone , as if the sea were pouring into a cavity of the earth .	In every direction in this bay , as well as in Talcahuano , vast bubbles broke , as if an immense evolution of gas were taking place , turning the colour of the water black , and exhaling a fetid sulphureous odour .	At San Tom6 , on the other side of the bay , the roller did immense damage ; and on the island of Quiriquina the cattle dashed off the cliffs from panic .

In many places the ground swelled like a large bubble , and then bursting , poured forth black and extraordinarily fetid water .	The limits to which the oscillations extended were , to the north as far as Coquimbo , and to Mendoza on the eastern ridge of the great chain of the Andes .

ro5874	smell	of ammonia		the adaptors					after being exposed to a moist air		In instances when the heat has been more rapidly raised , IN2 4S55 have generally found more potassium destroyed , and less nitrogene in proportion in the aeriform products .	In such cases likewise , the loss of weight has been much greater ; the gases have been always clouded , and the adaptors , after being exposed to a moist air , emitted a smell of ammonia ; from which it seems likely that small quantities of the dark gray substance described in page 50 of this Volume , are sometimes carried over undecompounded in the operation .	In some late experiments , I substituted for the iron tube , a tube of copper , which had been bored from a solid piece , and the sides of which were nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness .

Its specific gravity was rather less than that of sulphur .
ro5878	smell				like newly distilled Spirit of Vitriol		you			will twinge the Nose	Samuel Fisher of Sheffield had made me acquainted with , viz .	If with a staff or other instrument you stir an heap of Ants , ( especially Horse - Ants , ) so as to anger them , they will let fall thereon a liquor , which if you presently smell to , will twinge the Nose like newly distilled Spirit of Vitriol .	Considering this , and likewise that a few drops of the Oil or Spirit of Vitriol will soon turn the bluish Syrup of Violets into a bright red ; and , as I am credibly informed , the juyces and tinctures of any other flowers or fruits of that or the like colour , I was easily induced to think , that this juice of Pismires might be of the same nature with the Oil of Vitriol , and other Acid Spirits , ( which have in the fore - mentioned respects the same effects with that Oil : ) And thereupon I sent to inquire of Mr .

ro5938	odour		ethereal								A considerable quantity of erythroglucine was introduced into a retort and distilled with a great excess of strong hydriodic acid , while a current of carbonic acid gas traversed the hot liquid .	A darkcoloured oil of an ethereal odour , and heavier than water , mingled with abundance of free iodine , passed over into the receiver , while a large quantity of a black humus - like body remained in the retort .	The latter substance was evidently an organic compound containing much iodine ; but as it was insoluble in all the usual solvents , such as 266 water , alcohol , and ether , it was impossible to purify it .

The scent of the Waters here is much like those of Bath in England , but not so strong , neither is the Taste so offensive On the contrary , when they have run so far from the Fountain , as to become cold , they are very potable , and are the only Waters the Inhabitants use .	But we , during our stay there , sent to a Fountain of very excellent Water , about an hour distant from the City .

When they are arrived to a convenient distance the fishermen , having provided the necessary apparatus , take the advantage of a sea wind , or a breeze blowing rather obliquely on the shore , to prevent the smelling of these animals ( who have that sense in great perfection , contributing to their safety ) , and with the assistance of very good dogs , endeavour in the night time to separate those that are the farthest advanced from those next the water , driving them different ways .	This they call making a cut , and is generally looked upon to be a most dangerous process , it being impossible to drive them in any particular direction , and difficult to avoid them ; but as they are advanced above the slope of the echourie , the darkness of the night deprives them of every direction to the water , so that they stray about and are killed at leisure , those that are nearest the shore being the first victims .

These were the smallest Openings : Others that were more large , swallowed up great Houses ; and out of some Gapings would issue whole Rivers of Water , spouted up a great height into the Air , which seemed to threaten a Deluge to that part of Port - Royal , which the Earthquake seemed to favour , accompanied with ill Stenches and ossensive Smells , by means of which Openings , and the Vapours at that time belched forth from the Earth into the Air ; the Sky , which before was clear and blue , was in a Minute ' s time become dull and reddish , looking ( as I have heard it compared often ) like a red hot Oven : All these dreadful Circumstances occurring at once , accompanied all the white with prodigious , loud Noises from the Mountains , occasioned by their falling , & amp ; c .	And also a hollow Noise under Ground , and People running from one place to another distracted with Fear , looking like so many Ghosts , and more resembling the Dead than the Living , made the whole so terrible , that People thought the Dissolution of the whole Frame of the World was at hand .

"In a short paper recently submitted to the Royal Society , I pointed out the existence of two aromatic diamines , both represented by the formula ( C , H4 ) "" C , HN = H2 N , and closely resembling each other , but differing in some of their fundamental characters to such an extent that I did not hesitate to assert their individuality , and to distinguish them as alpha - phenylene - diamine and beta - phenylene - diamine ."	The existence of two closely allied bodies among the diatomic derivatives of the phenyl - series very naturally suggested the idea of searching for two similarly related monatomic bases of the same group , and accordingly I undertook during the last week a careful comparison of specimens of aniline prepared by different processes .

Small flocculent 521 shreds slowly subsided in the muriatic solution , derived probably from the mernbranous part of the shelly matter of the limestone ; for this insoluble residuum , when thrown into redhot nitre , slightly deflagrated , and gave out an odour resembling burnt bones : and as this residuum had been collected without the use of a filter , the inflammable matter could not well have been derived from any other source than the stone itself .	The muriatic solution contained a small proportion of iron , and gave a very slight trace of magnesia .

The formation of benzonitrile is easily explained .

The conversion of aniline into benzoic acid , an acid richer in carbon than this base , claims some interest , inasmuch as the development of the manufacture of coal - tar colours places the aromatic monamines at our disposal in abundant quantity , and at the cheapest price .	It was by no means improbable that some of the acids , already known , might in this manner be more easily prepared than heretofore , nor was it doubtful that the formation of many new compounds could be accomplished by this process .

Although the AEquilibrium within Places confined is maintained by the external Air , yet unless , by Openings properly adapted , the Air is suffered to pass freely through , the external Air proves as a Stopple to the internal , and only mixes with the next in Contact ; as is evident from the common Occurrence in Privies , which are scarcely offensive in clear Weather , but are much so in foul or windy , from a Diminution of the incumbent Pressure , when the Vapours that have been pent up , expand themselves to a considerable Distance .

As to the flying away of those Birds , they are wont to begin their flight in the months of September and October , for the most part without danger : But if they chance to delay it till November or December , it ' s often disturbed and interrupted , not only by the shortness of the Day - light , but likewise with most thick Fogs rising from the Baltic : For , falling into Darkness and Fogs in their flight , they first lose their way , and at length , being tired with continual flying , they fall into the Waters , their Bodies being found in heaps , driven to the Shores .

The physician informs me , that the blood and juices appeared to be highly putrid , and that the disease was attended with a violent inflammatory fever , which carried them off in about five days .

Now since we perceive that the Animalcula in the Testicles of a Ram , can live 32 hours after the Ram is dead , we may very well conclude , that the said Animalcula in Semine Masculino of a Ram , being admitted into that part of the Womb of the Ewe , which is called Tuba Fallopiana , will live much longer , that being the place which Nature has provided for them .

At the end of fifteen days it looked a little less fresh , but was not at all withered ; and having taken it out , I found , it had still its good smell ; but after that , it lost all both colour and smell in less than two hours .	I must also add , that its leaves did not appear moist in the vacuum , but they looked all moist as soon as they were in the Air .
ro6169	smell	of Strawberries		They							Having included some Strawberries , at the end of two days they looked less fresh ; but after that , seeing they changed no more , I took them out of the vacuum , after they had been there fifteen days .	They had still the smell and taste of Strawberries ; but they had also contracted a very ungrateful taste of the cement which I then employed to close them up with .	At another time , I put up some Strawberries without cement , making use of a skin after themanner described formerly , and I then observed nothing new , except that their taste kept good , but was a little sowrish , and that they yielded a little water .
ro6169	smell	they					I				But I was surprised , five days after , to see that bubles were formed in the Turpentin which I had put about the said great Glass in the place where it was fastned to its cover , and that these bubles were burst outwards ; and afterwards , having seen that the cover held fast to the Bolthead no longer , I made no doubt of the Corants having produced Air enough to lift up the said great Glass , and to form in the Turpentin the bubles I had seen .	I was confirmed in this thought , when I found by the smell that they had fermented .	They were yet good , except some that had lost almost all their taste , and all their acidity .
ro6169	smell	roasted Mutton|it	very ill				I				I did once put up some Bread with a Gage ; but I found not that for the space of a whole month it had yielded any Air ; so that I took it out , and sound it yet good ; only it had a little taste of mustiness , which yet appeared not at all to the Eye , and whereof the cause may be adscribed to that little Air that might rest in the Receiver .	One day I included a piece of roasted Mutton with a Gage , and found , that in four days it had yielded no Air ; but after my absence of six weeks I saw the Mercury was risen to the middle of the Gage ; and having taken out the meat , I found it of a very ill smell .	Two days after , I included a piece of raw Beef and a Gage with it , and I saw , that in two days the Quicksilver was risen an inch in the Gage ; and after six weeks absence , I found , the Mercury was got almost to the top of the Gage , and that this meat had contracted a much worse smell than that which had been roasted .

I also kept for fifteen days a piece of fresh Butter in vacuo , and I found , that it smelt more strong than when I first put it in : But yet it could be still eaten upon bread ; whereas another piece of Butter , which at the same time I had kept in the Air , was altogether unfit to be eaten .

These are almost all the Experiments I have made touching the Conservation of Bodies in vacuo .

I once made out of Vitriol , common Salt , and Antimony , a Liquor clear as any Fountain - water , yet the Smell intolerably sulphureous , continuing so many years : And true inflamable Sulphur may several ways be recovered out of Oil of Vitriol , or Sulphur , many times rectified , and in appearance free from such mixture .	We formerly mentioned its separation by means of vinous Spirits .

Kaempfer , in the account he gives of his Sitz - dsju , or true Varnishtree , takes notice of the effect of its poisonous exhalations : which brings fresh into my memory that this China Rhus , when first it began to extend its leaves in your small stove , had so remarkable a disagreeable smell , that I have frequently complained to you of getting the head - ach and a sickness at my stomach by remaining too long near it ; and after you had it removed into your great stove , where , notwithstanding that building is very spacious , and near twenty feet high , yet , as it grew most luxuriantly , one could not without pain continue long near it .	I measured one of the whole great leaves of this tree in the summer 1755 , and it was above three feet in length .

Some people say they observed smoke whilst these stones fell ; and also that when they were picked up a smell was observable , as between sulphur and gunpowder .	The stone which you receive lay one hour distance from the place where the others were found .
ro6192	odour|smell	Chloride of terephthalyl	very pungent		like that of chloride of benzoyl|which|resembles				at the ordinary temperature|when heated		) .	Chloride of terephthalyl is a solid and beautifully crystalline substance , without odour at the ordinary temperature , but evolving , when heated , a very pungent smell like that of chloride of benzoyl , which it resembles in all its reactions .	With the alcohols it forms terephthalic ethers , with ammonia an amide , and with the organic bases compound amides .
ro6192	odour	Terephthalylnitril									It distils over in form of a liquid , which solidifies in the neck of the retort .	Terephthalylnitril is colourless and without odour , and forms beautiful prismatic crystals .	It is insoluble in water , readily soluble in boiling alcohol , less soluble in cold alcohol , and insoluble in benzol .
ro6192	aqueous	of the oxy - terephthalamic acid									The several derivatives he obtained by this reaction from oxy - benzamic acid have their representatives in the bibasic terephthalyl series , and are obtained with the utmost facility .	On acting with nitrous acid upon an aqueous solution of the oxy - terephthalamic acid instead of an alcoholic solution , as is employed in Griess ' s reaction , this substance is readily decomposed , nitrogen is given off in large quantities , and there gradually separates a whitish substance which is oxy - terephthalic acid , C8 I ' t 0 .	This acid is a substance of great interest , and its preparation offering much less difficulty than the analogous oxy - acids of the aromatic series , it affords an opportunity of studying to a fuller extent the nature of this class of acids , especially as it may be expected that the history of this acid will throw some light on the law of polybasicity .

Now if we except the more important senses of seeing , hearing , smelling , and tasting , which do not belong to the electric organs , there is no part even of the most perfect animal , which , in proportion to it ' s size , is so liberally supplied with nerves ; nor do the nerves seem necessary for any sensation which can be supposed to belong to the electric organs .	And with respect to action , there is no part of any animal , with which I am acquainted , however strong and constant it ' s natural actions may be , which has so great a proportion of nerves .

The oil , when analysed , was found to have the formula C5 H12 02 , or the triple of this , C15 H6 06 , presenting the lremarkable circumstance of a volatile aromatic oil containing oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions to form water .	This proved it to differ essentially from other known oils , all of which contain an excess of hydrogen .

Fucusol very closely resembles furfurol both in its taste and smell , though the odour of fucusol is much fainter and more agreeable .	Fucusol requires 14 parts by weight of water at 130 C .

From this was obtained , with a very gentle heat , two Pounds , fourteen Ounces , and six Drachms of a Phlegmatic Liquor , that had scarce any thing of the faetid Scent , which is usual in the distillation of Animal Substances ; and its Specific Gravity was nearly the same with that of common Water , being but 1000 , 8 .	This being mixed with a strong solution of Alum , scarce afforded any Coagulum ; but exhibited a considerable one upon mixture with a solution of Roman Vitriol .

The distillation being continued with the same Heat , we had seven Ounces more of Phlegm considerably impregnated with Volatile Salt , as was manifest from the Smell .	The Specific Gravity of this was 1007 , and having mixed it with Tinctura Martis optima , Solution of Alum , and of Roman Vitriol , a large Coagulum was precipitated .
ro6230	stench	of sulphur	so strong							as almost to endanger suffocation	For some time , it was supposed that these three rooms only had suffered ; but , going to view the ruins on the outside , I observed some traces of mischief in the roof of the garret opposite to that first mentioned , and near 40 feet West of the chimney which was beaten down .	I immediately went into this garret , and though all had been over for more than an hour , the stench of sulphur remained so strong as almost to endanger suffocation .	This garret had been for some time used as a lumber - room by the bursar , and , within a few feet of the place where the lightening entered , lay a heap of old iron casements ; it came in here with an amazing force , and shivered the side - beam of the roof into ten thousand little splinters , scarcely larger than common needles .

On heating the liquid , boiling between 150 ? and 160 ? , with powdered caustic potash , a violent reaction set in , and , besides water , a heavy oil distilled over , which possessed the somewhat garlic - like odour of epidichlorhydrine , and which boiled between 95 ? and 105 ? .	The higher chlorinated products contained in the original liquid were destroyed by this reaction , carbonaceous matter being left with the potassium chloride in the retort .

I was called to a Woman aged about 28 Years , ~ Months and a half gone in her third Child , she was Feverish , and raved a little ; on Examination , I found the ~ uteri Internum dilated about the largeness of a Crown ; she complained of Pains in those Parts : This , joined with that of a Fall from a Stair about eight days before , determined me to assist Nature , which seemed ready to Relieve herself of that Burden ; I caused to be given her some Aliment , to prepare her for a Work in which she stood in need of force , and one Hour after I delivered her happily of a Male Child , that lived half an Hour , and received Baptism ; this Child was big and strong , and all the Parts of the Body well proportioned , as they ought to be naturally , except the Head , the hinder Part whereof was flat , as if it had been taken off with the Stroke of some Weapon , even to the Os Sphaenoides ; there was neither Brain , Cerebellum , nor Medulla oblongata ; the Cavity which ought to contain these was very superficial ; I found in their place , a black and livid Substance , covered with a Membrane , which may be the Dura and Pia Matter joined together ; this Substance had coloured the Os petrosum and other Bones of a deep red Colour , I thrust a Stilet or Probe into the Cavity of the Vertebres , where ought to be placed the Medulla Spinalis , but found no opposition ; for in effect , it was filled with a red stinking Liquor , contained in the Membranes of the Medulla Spinalis ; the Visage of this Child was a little deform , because of the want of the Cranium , which might have been communicated to the Bones as yet tender , that sustained the Skin of the Face .	The great Motion of the Eyes of this Child , during the time it lived , gave me the Curiosity to search the Cause ; I was assisted by a skilful Anatomist , who was surprised with me , to find nothing in the place of Muscles cles and Nerves , but Skins and Filaments very small , and not capable of Contraction , mixed in a ~ Humor , so that this great Motion might rather proceed from the Motion of the Palpebrae .

By heating these nitro - compounds with tin and hydrochloric acid , a portion is converted into a black tarry mass , and the solution contains a considerable quantity of chloride of ammonium , and a small quantity of a hydrochlorate , which can be obtained as a crystalline deliquescent mass by evaporating in vacuo .

Therefore it is , that valetudinarians , by changing foul or unwholesome air for a free , good , open air , often recover from lingring diseases .	And a third principal use of respiration is , to promote the exhibition of a voice in animals ; which all those that live on the land do according to their specific natures .
ro6374	putrid|putrid	animals	putrid|putrid								From these considerations it appears , beyond contradiction , that the phocae of every kind are under an absolute necessity of making the land their principal residence ; but there is another very convincing argument why they reside on shore the greatest part of their time , and that is , that the flesh of these creatures is analogous to that of other land animals ; and therefore , by over - long maceration , added to the fatigue of their chacing their prey , they would suffer such a relaxation as would destroy them .	It is well known that animals , which have lain long under water , are reduced to a very lax and even putrid state ; and the phoca must bask in the air on shore ; for while the solids are at rest , they acquire their former degree of tension , and the vigour of the animal is restored ; and while he has an uninterrupted placid respiration , his blood is refreshed by the new supply of air , as I have explained it above , and he is rendered fit for his next cruise : for action wastes the most exalted fluids of the body , more or less , according to its duration and violence ; and the restorative rest must continue a longer or shorter time , according to the quantity of the previous fatigue .	Let us now examine by what power these animals are capable of remaining longer under water than land animals .
ro6375	smell	her breath	very strong				I	In a few days			But what was very remarkable in this case , notwithstanding the great agonies she was in whilst awake , yet the second night after the accident happened , she fell asleep about twelve o ' clock ( whilst insensible ) slept sound for several hours ; and whilst in that state of relaxation fetched her breath quite easy , as she did every night after , when asleep , with a serene pulse , but always waked in exquisite pain , and in great agitations .	In a few days I observed her breath to smell very strong , and I made a prognostic , that nature ( in order to expel her enemy ) would form an abscess or apostemation in the lungs ( as the only chance for her life ) and would bring it up , by the same channel it went down ; though I was not without apprehensions ( as there was a prominence pointing outwards , and attended with great soreness ) that an empyema or collection of matter would be formed in the concavity of the breast , which , if it had made its way outwards , would ( in all probability ) have proved fatal .	However , on the eleventh day from the accident , she was of a sudden seized in the morning in bed , with a nausea , violent sickness , and a cough , when the impostume in her lungs broke and discharged itself by the mouth , with a large quantity of bloody matter , in which the portion of crust was happily entangled , about the bigness of a large hazel nut , or filberd ( being rather oblong than round ) with a great quantity of slimy substance , in which it was enveloped .

During the latter part of the oxidizing process , and after the disappearance of the white fumes , a considerable quantity of inflammable gas , having the properties of hydride of ethyl , was evolved .

A preliminary experiment showed that water acted upon it energetically , the solid became transitorily coloured yellow , a peculiar odour was developed , similar to that produced when iodine is dissolved in a solution of a caustic alkali , and the water became impregnated with alcohol , for on being treated with acetate of potash and sulphuric acid , it gave the characteristic odour of acetic ether .	After washing the solid residue of this reaction with a small quantity of water , and drying in vacuo , it yielded a mere trace of carbonic acid on ignition with oxide of copper , and was found to be pure oxide of zinc .

C .	it exhaled a peculiar ethereal odour and became of a bright yellow colour ; this ingredient is present , however , in small quantity only , and I have not succeeded in isolating it ; possibly it is either aldehyde , or some product of the action of zincethyl upon acetic acid .	The most interesting reaction in the oxidation of zincethyl , and that to which I therefore directed my chief attention , is the formation of ethylate of zinc ; not as regards the new compound of ether and zinc itself , but on account of the extraordinary modus operandi of the oxygen in its production .

Carefully dried flowers of sulphur have only a slight action upon an ethereal solution of zincethyl , but the application of a gentle heat suffices to produce a brisk reaction ; the sulphur gradually disappears , a white flocculent precipitate is formed , and a strong odour of sulphide of ethyl is developed .	The chief product of this reaction is the double sulphide of ethyl and zinc ( mercaptide of zinc ) , which is produced as follows : t4H5Zn } _ C H , S + ZnS .

Thus prepared , acetate of allyl is a colourless liquid , lighter than water , possessing a pungent aromatic smell , and boiling between 98 ? and 100 ? C .	Potassa decomposes it at the boiling temperature , giving rise to the formation of acetate of potassium and reproducing allylic alcohol .

By this means a colourless very limpid liquid is obtained , boiling at 82 ? , possessing an extremely pungent odour , which , like that of cyanic ether , produces lacrymation in a high degree .	When mixed with ammonia , this substance rapidly disappears , a gentle evolution of heat being perceptible , and the solution furnishes on evaporation a magnificently crystallized body which is the allylic urea .

When exposed to heat they did not easily melt , but as soon as inflamed , they emitted a resinous odour mixed with that of fat oil , and produced a very light coal , much exceeding the bulk of the original substance .	Alcohol completely dissolved them , and if water in a large proportion was added to a saturated solution , a precipitate was obtained , but after each precipitation , a portion always remained dissolved by the water , which acted upon the different reagents in a manner similar to the solutions of vegetable extractive matter .

The flavour was also bitter , and in some degree aromatic , so that the residua , whether obtained from pit - coal , from Cannel coal , or from asphaltum , seemed to possess properties intermediate between those of resin , and those of the vegetable extractive substance .	They appeared however , to be removed only by a very few degrees from the tanning substance ; for if digested in a small quantity of nitric acid , and subsequently evaporated , they were immediately converted into it ; or if digested with sulphuric acid , they speedily became reduced to coal .

It burned with some flame , emitted still a slight vegetable odour , and was reduced to ashes much sooner than the coal formed by sulphuric acid , but not so speedily as the oak charcoal .	The ashes had an ochraceous appearance , and were almost devoid of any saline substance , excepting a very slight trace of muriate of potash .
ro6493	odour						I		when burned		True it is indeed , that bitumen has never been formed by any artificial process hitherto devised , from the resins or other vegetable substances .	I have myself attempted it in various ways without success , for although I occasionally obtained products which resembled it somewhat in odour when burned , and other properties , yet the effects of alcohol or water always proved these products not to be bitumen .	But synthesis of natural products , although required in strict chemical demonstration , is ( as we have but too often occasion to know ) seldom to be attained , especially when operations are performed on bodies whose component parts are liable to an infinite series of variations in their proportions , qualities , and mode of combination .
ro6493	odour	by most of the mineral coals							when burned		Considering therefore , that bitumen and resin afford by certain operations similar products , that resin and bitumen are found blended together by nature , and that this mixed substance accompanies a species of coal which in many parts still exhibits its vegetable origin , whilst in others it passes into pit - coal , we may with the greatest probability conclude , that bitumen is a modification of the resinous and oily parts of vegetables , produced by some process of nature , which has operated by slow and gradual means on immense masses , so that even if we were acquainted with the process , we should scarcely be able to imitate its effects , from the want of time , and deficiency in the bulk of materials .	But although bitumen cannot at present be artificially formed from the resinous and other vegetable substances by any of the known chemical processes , yet there is every reason to believe , that the agent employed by nature in the formation of coal and bitumen has been either muriatic or sulphuric acid ; and when it is considered , that common salt is never found in coal mines except when in the vicinity of salt springs , whilst on the contrary , pyrites , sulphate of iron , and alum , most commonly are present ; * these facts , together with the sulphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral coals when burned , appear strongly to evince the agency of the latter .	That this has been the case , seems also to be corroborated , by the great resemblance which ( as has been previously stated ) the coals formed artificially from many vegetable substances bear to the mineral coals , especially as the similarity is not confined to external characters , but extends to other properties .
ro6496	fetid|fetid	pus	fetid|fetid								Pearson infers that pus essentially consists of three distinct substances : first , an animal oxide in the form of fine curdy particles , not soluble in water , not coagulable into one mass by hot water ; secondly , a limpid fluid , like serum of blood , and like it coagulable by heat or by alcohol ; and thirdly , innumerable spherical particles , visible only by the microscope , not soluble in hot or cold water , and specifically heavier than water .	He observes also , that other extraneous matters are sometimes mixed with pus : that whenever pus is fetid , it is in the state of putrefactive fermentation ; that the several ingredients in pus are products of secretion ; that the varieties of purulent matter depend on the proportion of its essential ingredients ; that the saline ingredients before named are dissolved in the serous fluid , and that the quantity of these is less than in an equal quantity of expectorated matter , but more than in an equal quantity of serum of blood .	That besides the consistence of pus depending upon the proportion of its essential ingredients , some difference may also arise from the mode or state of coagulation of the matter which gives the opacity .

The alcohol of sulphur is not soluble in water , though it imparts to it some of its odour ; this appears to be owing to its impregnating the atmospheric air contained in the water , rather than the water itself .	It readily mixes , and perfectly incorporates with either the fixed or volatile oils ; but if it hold sulphur in solution , the latter separates in a crystalline form .
ro6502	smell	matter			of hepar sulphuris				is burnt in carbonic acid gas		On being heated in contact with potassium , the alcohol of sulphur suffers no change or decomposition , when in its liquid state ; but if it be brought to the state of vapour , by the exclusion of the air , and heat applied , the potassium becomes ignited in the vapour , and emits a reddish flame .	During this species of combustion , a blackish film appears upon the potassium , ( as happens when potassium is burnt in carbonic acid gas ) , and on introducing water , a greenish solution is obtained , which contains - a quantity of carbonaceous matter , and has the smell and other properties of hepar sulphuris .	Neither mercury nor amalgams of silver , or of lead , are at all acted upon by this liquor , if it has been carefully distilled ; but if it contain any sulphur in solution , the amalgam blackens , and sulphurets of silver , or of lead , are produced , after which the liquor remains pure , and unsusceptible of further alteration .

After an hour and a half the process was stopped , and the liquor was found to have absorbed a considerable quantity of the gas , which had imparted to it a peculiar and extremely strong odour .

The water had acquired a peculiar smell , and contained , after the expulsion of the oxymuriatic gas , a little muriatic acid , with a vestige of sulphuric acid .	Here again it remained doubtful , whether the production of muriatic acid was owing to the alcohol of sulphur containing hydrogen , which , by uniting with the oxygen of the oxymuriatic acid , had formed water ; or whether this appearance of minute quantities of muriatic and sulphuric acid , might not be explained in some other manner .

With this view , we heated to incipient redness , in glass tubes , various metallic oxyds , such as red oxyd of iron , black oxyd of manganese , oxyd of tin ; and we caused quantities of the oily liquor in vapour to pass through these ignited oxyds , The liquor was , by that means , entirely decomposed ; the metallic oxyds were converted into sulphu ~ rets ~ and thegases aquired strong smell of sulphureous lSi acid .	But we could not , in any of our experiments , detect the least production of water , although our apparatus was so devised , as to render the smallest quantity of water conspicuous , and although we burnt , in some instances , as much as fifty or sixty grains of the liquor .

The remaining gas being agitated with lime water was partly absorbed , and produced a precipitate of carbonate of lime .

After a contact of about one hour , between the brown oxyd of lead and our mixed gases , the whole of the sulphureous acid gas was so completely absorbed , that the carbonic acid gas which remained in the vessel , had not the least sulphureous smell , and yet the carbonic acid itself remained perfectly unaltered in its bulk , after continuing in contact with the oxyd of lead for the space of three days .	* 8 .
ro6502	smell	of ammonia	strong	This substance							The whole of the sulphuret of carbon was then found converted into the yellowish uncrystallized matter just described .	This substance had a strong smell of ammonia , and was so deliquescent that it could not be transferred from one vessel into another , without undergoing an obvious alteration .	The solution of this substance in water is first red , but it very soon passes to a deep orange colour , showing that it undergoes a partial decomposition ; and if it be distilled in its solid , though humid state , it sublimes and deposits small shining crystals of hydrosulphuret of ammonia ; whilst , on the contrary , if it be heated in the same vessel in which it is formed , that is , without any access of air or moisture , the carbosulphuret of ammonia sublimes unchanged , from one part of the vessel to the other , and no vestige of hydrosulphuret is perceived .
ro6502	smell	of sulphuretted hydrogen						soon			The earth , at its surface , is found yellowish , owing to the formation of a little sulphuret of lime , but this appearance ceases on removing the surface , showing that it arises from the contact of air .	The earthy mass is tasteless , when first applied to the tongue , but a bitter taste , with a smell of sulphuretted hydrogen are soon perceived .	It is no longer susceptible of being heated or dissolved by water .
ro6502	odour		peculiar		resembling that of muriated sulphur				The acid		A portion of sulphuret of carbon was exposed to the action of a mixture of fuming nitric acid with concentrated muriatic acid .	The acid instantly acquired a peculiar odour resembling that of muriated sulphur .	Upon trying to promote the combination by applying heat , the sulphuret of carbon was expelled in the form of vapour , which obliged us to leave the mixture to its own spontaneous action , under the temperature of the atmosphere , which was then at least 7o ? .
ro6502	smell	nitrous|of muriated sulphur	strong								Upon trying to promote the combination by applying heat , the sulphuret of carbon was expelled in the form of vapour , which obliged us to leave the mixture to its own spontaneous action , under the temperature of the atmosphere , which was then at least 7o ? .	* The sulphuret of carbon soon passed to a reddish orange colour , which it communicated to the acid ; and during this change , nitrous gas , with a strong smell of muriated sulphur , was slowly evolved .	After the space of a week , the liquor began to cover itself with a white crystalline substance , losing at the same time its colour .
ro6502	smell	it|its			resembled both that of muriated sulphur|of oxyd of osmium						This , however , in proportion as it saturated itself with the new formed substance , gradually lost its colour , acquired a greater consistence , and at last , at the end of three weeks , it was entirely converted into a solid white crystalline body , having the appearance of camphor .	This substance being separated from the acid , and washed with cold water , presented the following characters : it was colourless ; its smell resembled both that of muriated sulphur and of oxyd of osmium ; its taste was both acrid and acid ; it was very volatile , melted at a gentle heat , and sublimed without residue .	In fact , this body very closely resembles camphor in its external properties .

From this solution , a spirituous liquor is obtained by distillation , which possesses the same smell , and leaves a residue of muriate and sulphate of zinc .	When a pure solution of the peculiar substance in alcohol is submitted to distillation , the products are , first , some Eulphureous acid gas , and then alcohol strongly impregnated with muriatic ether ; after which the air of the 196g vessel is found to contain portions of sulphureous and carbonic acid .
ro6502	smell	of sublphureous acid		the liquor					Sulphuric acid		This solution is colourless ; when neutralized by sulphuric acid no precipitation takes place from it , which shows that the alkali decomposes the peculiar body .	Sulphuric acid , however , produces a slight effervescence , and the liquor exhales a smell of sublphureous acid .	On adding to it a solution of sulphate of silver , muriated silver is precipitated , These results tend to show , that the substance in question contains sulphur and carbon in combination with oxygen , that is in the state of sulphureous and carbonic acid ; for otherwise , some carbon would have been precipitated , or some sulphuret or hydrosulphuret of potash would have been formed .
ro6503	smell	oil of vitriol									Mc NAB , which , he supposes , were weaker , as the former acids had been concentrated purposely .	The observations which I have made , and am going to relate , apply solely to the latter kind of congelation of the vitriolic acid , as the acid which I employed was of the kind that is prepared by burning sulphur , and is commonly sold in England under the name of oil of vitriol , and was perfectly free from colour , smell , or smoking quality .	After a severe frost at the end of the year 1784 , and beginning of 1785 , I observed that some vitriolic acid , contained in a corked phial , had congealed ; while other parcels of the same acid , some stronger and some weaker , equally exposed to the cold , had remained fluid .
ro6520	odour	It	very disagreeable foetid								A great deal of combustible but non - condensable gas was evolved .	It had a very disagreeable foetid odour .	The liquid which passed into the receiver was strongly alkaline , so much so as to require about a third of its bulk of mnuriatic acid of ordinary strength to neutralize it .

Their odour also differed considerably from that of the bases from beans , which however they closely resembled in other respects ; their basic properties were equally decided , and they also formed similar salts .	It appears probable enough terefore that some of the bases in both series are identical .
ro6520	odour	The empyreumatic products|from either oil - cake|from beans	much less offensive		those						The amount of acetone and wood - spirit was also very considerable .	The empyreumatic products had a much less offensive odour than those from either oil - cake or from beans .	The amount of ammonia was by no means inconsiderable , but the quantity of organic bases was less than I expected .
ro6520	smelling|smelling aromatic|aromatic	oil	very agreeably smelling|smelling aromatic|aromatic								By cautiously rectifying the product of the distillation , a clear , strongly alkaline liquid was procured .	It contained a large amount of ammonia , a little of a very agreeably smelling aromatic oil , and a considerable quantity of organic bases .

The peculiarly disagreeable odour of the ammoniacal liquors , derived from putrid substances , appears to indicate the presence of such bases .	And I should not be at all surprised , if , from the very gentle nature of the process , putrefaction should prove to be the most advantageous method of preparing the volatile alkaloids on a large scale .

It became very putrid and was full of maggots .	It was then supersaturated with muriatic acid , and repeatedly agitated with water so long as anything was dissolved .
ro6520	odour	It	pleasant aromatic								By repeated rectifications with caustic soda , a quantity of a light oily fluid consisting of one or more bases was separated .	It had a pleasant aromatic odour , and was exceedingly soluble in water , from which however it separated , when sufficiently concentrated , as a transparent colourless oil , which was strongly alkaline , saturating acids and forming salts similar to those of the preceding bases .	I was surprised however to find that it did not contain any aniline .

Besides much ammonia they contained a considerable quantity of a basic oil but slightly soluble in water , of a very peculiar and penetrating odour resernbling that of the borage plant .	It neutralized acids perfectly , and was evidently quite distinct from any of the bases previously met with .

At first both Phials had some Degree of a putrid Smell ; but being corked , and kept a few Days near a Fire , the Mixture with plain Water contracted a strong Faetor , whilst the other smelled only of the Flowers .	Thus far have I related the Experiments made of Antiseptics ; by which it appears , that besides Spirits , Acids , and Salts , we are possessed of many powerful Resisters of Putrefaction , endued with Qualities of heating , cooling , Volatility , Astriction , and the like , which make some more adapted than others to particular Indications .

ro6542	smell	of nitrous acid	very faint								The liquor saturated with vegetable alkali being slowly evaporated to dryness , and the precipitat es mixed with the brown sediment being put into a retort , some concentrated vitriolic acid was added , and heat was applied .	A very faint smell of nitrous acid arose , but no visible red vapour ; nor did any thing distil into the receiver until the heat was very considerable .	11 .

The distilled liquor , besides having the taste of nitrous acid , dissolved silver ; and when neutralized by vegetable alkali and slowly evaporated , afforded well - formed crystals of common nitre .
ro6542	smell	of nitrous acid	very little						submitted|with the addition of concentrated vitriolic acid		It is not quite so clear why the liquor and sediment in ~ IV .	gave no stronger marks of the presence of nitrous acid ; but it is evident , that the acid had united itself to the iron , if not to the tin , of the vessel employed : and I find , that when nitrous acid is fully saturated with iron by being boiled with it , and fixed alkali is added , this mixture submitted to distillation , with the addition of concentrated vitriolic acid , yields no red vapours , and very little smell of nitrous acid .	I remain , & amp ; c .
ro6542	smell								when saturated with alkali		The consideration of this fact ought to enter into the estimates of the proportions of the component parts of salts .	distillation a colourless acid liquor , which from the smell , the properties of dissolving silver very readily , and of giving a deflagrating quality to paper soaked in this liquor when saturated with alkali , evidently manifested the presence of the nitrous acid .	But besides the nitrous , which is undoubtedly the acid in greatest abundance , I think I may venture to affirm the existence also of the marine acid .
ro6542	smell|fumes|fumes	the|the|fumes|fumes	yellow				I		on adding the|the solution of silver|during the solution		CAVENDISH had also observed , in the acid produced in his experiment of passing the electric spark through a mixture of dephlogisticated and phlogisticated airs , a precipitation upon adding a solution of silver ; from which , however , that most accurate philosopher would not infer the presence of marine acid , having discovered that the precipitation might be produced by the nitrous acid itself , when that acid is much phlogisticated .	The acid of the green liquor is in some degree phlogisticated , as appears both from the smell which I perceived on adding the solution of silver , which , as I have mentioned , contained a superabundant acid , and from the green colour of the liquor ; for I have never been able to make any but blue or greenish - blue saturated solutions from copper and nitrous acid , although they sometimes appear green from a superabundant quantity of yellow acid , or from the yellow fumes during the solution .	By adding a solution of melted nitre to the blue solutions of copper either in the nitrous or vitriolic acids , the phlogisticated acid of the melted nitre immediately communicates a green colour .

But it was very observable , that when it was almost evaporated to a dryness , there arose invisible pungent vapours , which smelt much like the vapour of burning brimstone ; which was observed , not only by myself , but by others , who came into my parlour .	This pungency was very strong , when my nose was near the flask , which was set in a pipkin surrounded with sand .

ro6587	smell	of sulphur	so intolerable							that	It was cracked in many parts , and appeared red - hot within , like an heated oven : this hollowed hillock might be about fifteen feet high , and the lava that ran from under it was received into a regular channel , raised upon a sort of wall of scoriae and cinders , almost perpendicularly , of about the height of eight or ten feet , resembling much an ancient aqueduct .	We then went up to the crater of the volcano , in which we found , as usual , a little mountain throwing scoriae and red - hot matter with loud explosions ; but the smoke and smell of sulphur was so intolerable , that we were under the necessity of quitting that curious spot with the utmost precipitation .	In another of my excursions to Mount Vesuvius last year , I picked up some fragments of large and regular crystals of close - grained lava or basalt , the diameter of which , when the prisms were complete , may have been eight or nine inches .

The smoke of Etna , though very sulphureous , did not appear to me so fetid and disagreeable as that of Vesuvius ; but our guide told me that its quality varies , as I know that of Vesuvius does , according to the quality of the matter then in motion within .	The air was so very pure and keen in the whole upper region of Etna , and particularly in the most elevated parts of it , that we had a difficulty in respiration , and that , independent of the sulphureous vapour .

In like manner I have been able to sweeten several small Pieces of putrid Flesh , by repeated Affusions of a strong Decoction of the Bark ; and I constantly observed , that not only the corrupted Smell was removed , but a Firmness restored to the Fibres .	Now , since the Bark parted with so much of its Virtue in Water , it was natural to think it would still yield more in the Body , when opened by the Saliva and Bile ; and therefore it was by this antiseptic * This Piece has been kept a Twelvemonth in the same Liquor , and is still firm and uncorrupted .
ro6642	Effluvia	of stagnating Water	putrid								They are the great Endemic of all marshy Countries , and rage most after hot Summers , with a close and moist State of Air .	They begin at the End of Summer , and continue thro ' Autumn ; being at the worst , when the Atmosphere is most loaded with the Effluvia of stagnating Water , tendered more putrid by Vegetables and animal Substances that rot in it .	At such times all Meats are quickly tain ~ ed ; and Dysenteries , with other putrid Distempers , coincide with these Fevers .
ro6642	Effluvia		putrid								At such times all Meats are quickly tain ~ ed ; and Dysenteries , with other putrid Distempers , coincide with these Fevers .	The Heats dispose the Humours to Acrimony ; the putrid : Effluvia are a Ferment ; and the Fogs and Dews , so , common to those Climates , stop Perspiration , and bring on a Fever .	The more these Causes prevail , the easier it is to trace this Putrefaction of Humours .

We shall add , that in moist Countries , in bad Seasons , the Intermittents not only begin with Symptoms of a putrid Fever , but , if unduly managed , easily change into a putrid and malignant Form , with livid Spots and Blotches , and Mortification of the Bowels .	But , as a thorough Discussion of this Question might carry us too far from our present Subject , and be unseasonable here , I shall refer it to its proper Place , and only remark , that whatever Medicines ( besides Evacuations and the Bark ) have been found useful in the Cure of Internrittents , they are , so far as I know , all highly antiseptic ; such are , Myrrh , Camphire , Camomile - flowers , Wormwood , Tincture of Roses , Alum with Nutmeg , vitriolic or strong vegetable Acids with Aromatics .

By the same means also pestilential infections are taken in : For as the salutary properties of good air are conveyed by the lungs , so are also the malignant qualities of bad air .

This unfavourable change was attended with the emission of a large quantity of air from the pleura , and with an alteration in the character of the fluid discharged , which had become more purulent , of a greenish hue , and of an offensive odour .	The patient expired suddenly on the 29th July .

In a former paper * I have described phenylene - diamine , an aromatic diamine which is formed by the action of powerful reducing agents upon dinitrobenzol .	Phenylene - diamine , the last product of this reaction , is preceded by the formation of an intermediate compound , nitraniline , a substance discovered many years ago by Dr .

On mixing a solution of beta - phenylene - diamine in sulphuric acid with peroxide of manganese , the odour of kinone becomes at once perceptible , and on heating the mixture , kinone distils overthe residuary liquid containing the sulphates of manganese and ammonium , C , H , 1 N + 2H2 , S04 M + Mn2 S0 , = 4 ( H4 N ) 2 SO , .	Beta - phenyKinone .

Alpha - phenylene - diamine , when similarly treated , evolves a faint odour of kinone , but does not yield crystals of this substance .	The elegant and easy formation of kinone in this reaction presents some interest , inasmuch as the process appears to be of general application , and will probably lead to the preparation of the higher homologues of kinone .

The Natives heretofore had nevertheless some advantage by the woods , and Bogs ; by them they were preserved from the conquest of the English ; and I believe it is a little remembrance of this , makes them still build near Bogs : it was an advantage then to them to have their country unpassable , and the fewer strangers came near them , they lived the easier ; for they had no inns , every house where you came , was your inn ; and you said no more , but put off your broges & amp ; sate down by the fire ; & amp ; since the natural Irish hate to mend high ways , and will frequently shut them up , and change them , ( being unwilling st rangers should come and burden them ; ) Tho ' they are very inconvenient to us , yet they are of some use ; for most of Ireland have their firing from from them ; Turf is accounted a tolerable sweet fire , and we having very impolitickly destroyed our wood , and not as yet found stone coal , save in few places , we could hardly live without some Bogs : I have seen turf charc ' d , it serves to work iron , and as I have bin informed , will serve to make it in a bloomery or iron - work : turf charced I reckon the sweetest and wholsomest fire , that can be ; fitter for a Chamber , and consumptive People , then either wood , stone - coal or char - coal .

The Earth and Stone are no farther warm than where the Fire reaches : And what seems very well worth Observation , this Flame of Fire gives neither Smoke nor Smell , however great it be .	About an English Mile and half from this Place there are Wells of white Naphtha ; which is exceedingly inflammable ; and though the Flame of Naptha affords both Smoke and Smell , it is highly probable the perpetual Fire I have been describing is owing to Naptha , but so purified , in filtring through the Stone , that it becomes divested of all such Particles as produce Smoke or Smell .

For baking and roasting they make use of Abrotanum , Absynthium , and such - like ; but in general Naphta is their Fire .
ro6676	smell	it							when rubbed|when powdered and thrown upon a hot iron		The following are its principal characters .	- It is of a dark gray colour ; it has a brilliant lustre , and is very brittle ; its hardness is such , that it very easily cuts calcareous spar , but is not sufficient to scratch fluor spar ; it slightly marks white paper ; when rubbed , it does not emit any smell ; when powdered and thrown upon a hot iron , it emits a phosphorescent light ; and its specific gravity is 5765 .	The form of its primitive crystal is a rectangular tetrahedral prism , with terminal faces perpendicular to its axis ; but as no specimen has yet been discovered in which the above - mentioned .
ro6682	putrid|putrid	faeces	putrid|putrid								As the salt was found to have undergone no change in the small guts , it appears , that it is not prevented from entering the lacteals by its being decomposed or precipitated , as has been imagined ; but , on the contrary , that what renders it incapable of being received by these vessels , is its astringency : for the lacteals seem to be endowed with that admirable faculty of admitting such particles of pure chyle as they happen to be in contact with , and of accommodating their diameters to them , at the same time that by their natural irritability , and power of constriction they obstinately exclude such as are astringent ; which , were they to enter the lacteals , would either produce dangerous obstructions in these vessels , or , if they got into the blood , would occasion polypous concretions in the larger vessels , or coagulations incapable of being transmitted thro ' the minute vessels of the lungs ; the effects of which would be either sudden death , or at least inflammations and suppurations from obstructions in the pulmonary vessels ; inconveniences , which nature , by precluding astringents from entering the lacteals , has carefully and wisely avoided .	Salt of steel , taken internally , must retain its astringency until it be precipitated ; which can scarce ever fail to happen in the great guts , from the putrid faeces they contain , which are always observed to be tinged of a black colour from the metallic basis of the salt , part of which , as it has little or no astringency , may , no doubt , enter the blood , as Signor Menghini observed of the crocus , which is the same substance ; and we know , from the experiments of Lister and Musgrave ~ , that particles much grosser than those of the white chyle , provided they be not astringent , or very acrid , are conveyed by the lacteals .	But the metallic basis being separated from its acid , and thus reduced to a mere calx or earth , can scarce be supposed to have any medicinal quality whatsoever , or at least to have any share in the virtues justly attributed to salt of steel .
ro6682	fetid|fetid	matter	fetid|fetid								That as this salt does not enter the blood , and consequently cannot be in danger of too much stimulating or constricting the vessels , on which it only acts by consent , it may , in small doses , be successfully used in many cases , where it has been imagined to be hurtful , particularly in consumptions of the lungs , so frequent and fatal in this island ; which are commonly attended with too great a laxity of the primae viae , and of the solids in general , tho ' they seem more immediately to proceed from a laxity and weakness of the pulmonary vessels ; in which circumstances it must be of the utmost consequence to restore the tone of those principal organs of chylification , the primae viae ; as good chyle not only corrects the acrimony of the blood , which in the advanced stages of consumptions so much prevails , but likewise saves a great deal of labour , which the lungs ( already too much oppressed ) must otherwise undergo from a crude and ill - concocted chyle .	Agreeably to this we find , in the Essays Physical and Literary of Edinburgh * , two well - vouched histories of patients far gone in consumptions , with the usual symptoms of pain in the breast , cough , gross spitting of fetid matter , difficulty of breathing , hectic fits , and morning sweats , perfectly cured in a few weeks , by the use of the Hartfell - Spaw near Moffat ; which , contrary to what is observed in most natural chalybeat waters , contains a fixed vitriol of iron .

On the other hand , Pines , Firs , Sassafras , Liquid Amber , or Sweet Gum , or all odoriferous Woods , and those that abound with a Resin or Gum , are unfit for Pot - ash , as their Ashes are well known , even to our Planters , to make a very weak Lye , unfit for Soap .	Besides these that contain little or no Salt , there are some other Vegetables that afford a large Quantity of it , but make a bad kind of Pot - ash , at least for many Purposes , on account of a neutral Salt with which they abound .

These Explosions were owing not so much to the included Air , which some perhaps may imagine , as to the sulphurcous Parts of the Composition expanding and flying off : For this boiled Lixivium had neither the green Colour , nor fetid sulphureous Smell and Taste ; at least in any degree like what it has when made of the same Pot - ash by a simple Infusion in warm Water .	9 .

From hence this learned Author concludes , that this Substance contained the active sulphureous Parts of the Wood , blended with more active igneous Particles .

The Direction of the Earthquake was from West to East ; as was very easily discerned by every body that was out of Door , as I was , and took notice of the Noise .
ro6716	smell	of the small quantities of liquid									The bridge was again pushed down and air again escaped copiously from the thermometers , but very soon beads of liquid began to appear following one another rapidly down the capillary tubes from the interior of the conductor .	As the spirits of wine had not once been allowed to run up into the bulb of either thermometer , these beads of liquid could be nothing but products of the distillation of the oil which had been used in the luting of the central plug ; and on taking away the cups of spirits of wine from below the tubes , the smell and taste of the small quantities of liquid which continued to descend gave unmistakeable evidence of their origin .	After this it was scarcely possible to get any satisfactory indication from either of the air - thermometers ; but the experiment was continued , and one or other of them , when by any means the beads of disturbing liquid could be sufficiently got rid of for a time , was steadied to a constant temperature ; the other thermometer being observed when possible , and the reversals repeated as before .

Examined by means of lime - water and phosphorus , it was found to consist of 93 azotic gas and 7 carbonic acid gas : thus , in composition , proving almost exactly the same as the air found in the fatal case described in the preceding part of this Paper ; and , as in that instance , it had not the least offensive smell .	Whether the origin of the air in this instance was the same as in the former , it is not easy at present to decide ; most probably it was , considering the nature of the preceding disease , and the sudden supervention of the symptoms of pneumato - thorax after a violent fit of coughing ; when it is likely the pleura was ruptured , and a kind of valvular communication established between its cavity and the aspera arteria , permitting air to enter , and preventing its return .

This substance , which was of a black colour , or rather of a dirty grey , which changed to black upon being exposed to the air , had a pungent , acrid , alkaline taste , and smelt like liver of sulphur .	It attracted moisture from the air with great avidity .

At the first sight of the plant , there is some likeness of Viscum or Loranthus ; and considering the inflorescentia , and the insertion of the antherae , we find no less analogy ; though on a nearer examination it is greatly different , and of a very intricate construction .

The Wild Penny - royal or Ditany of Virginia , grows straight up about one foot high , with the leaves like Penny royal , with little blue tufts at the joining of the branches to the Plant , the colour of the Leaves being a reddish green , but the Water distilled , of the colour of Brandy , of a fair Yellow : the Leaves of it bruised are very hot and biting upon the Tongue : and of these , so bruised , they took some , and having tied them in the cleft of a long stick , they held them to the Nose of the Ratle - Snake , who by turning and wriggling laboured as much as she could to avoid it : but she was killed with it , in less than half an hour ' s time , and , as was supposed , by the scent thereof ; which was done Anno 1657 .	in the Month of July , at which season , they repute those creatures to be in the greatest vigour for their poison .
ro6829	smell		very putrid						by putrefaction		Dr .	Gaber has proved , by his experiments , the presence of a volatile alcali produced by putrefaction ; but as he did not discover by the same proceedings [ b ] any in its beginning or end , though there was a very putrid smell , he denies its existence in these states , and concludes , that this volatile alcali is not a necessary product of putrefaction [ c ] .	This doctrine seemed to me not quite conformable to the phenomenon : for , as all smell , as much as we know at least till now , depends on a saline matter , joined with a [ b ] Acta Taurinens .

The 22d , the putrid smell was very sensible : but I let it stand till the 24th , when I poured off the fluid [ d ] , adding again about the same quantity of water to the flesh .	I filtrated then the fluid through a piece of fine linen , and mixed with some of it the syrup of violets , which it did not alter ; neither did it effervese with the spirit of vitriol , diluted to a sharpness near that of the vegetable acid .

I thought of keeping it in digestion for some days ; but , for fear that some little solid particles might have passed through the linen , and by that means , in growing putrid , might give some alcali , and render the trial inaccurate , I distilled the fluid by a heat of about 160 ~ , after which , I repeated the trial with the syrup of violets and the spirit of vitriol ; but it produced no [ d ] It requires some attention to find out the proper time when to pour off the liquor ; if it is done too soon , it will give too little volatile alcali to be much sensible by experiments ; for , though it smells strongly , it is known how little matter is required to produce a strong smell .	If it is delayed too - long , it shows already signs of an alcali .

In the mean time , the flesh with the water continued to emit a putrid stench ; and the 28th of June I found the fluid colouring the syrup of violets greenish , and showing a kind of effervescence with the acid .

The reason , why the volatile alcali has been distinctly observed at a certain period of putrefaction , and not in the others , is , I believe , this ; the volatile alcali has , it seems , a tendency , to disentangle itself , by intestine motion , of all such matter as it is involved with ; but if it is not combined with such fixed matter as retains it till it has gone through all its evolutions , it is , being itself volatile , carried off by the still more volatile phlogistic matter with which it is commonly joined .

For this reason , I suppose , the putrefying matter shows in its beginning no sign of a volatile alcali ; because its smell depends only on those particles , which have been on the surface , without any strong cohesion with the substance .	In the farther progress of putrefaction , the matter involving the alcali , or forming it , is intermixed , and in cohesion with the solid particles of the substance , and is by these means retained till the alcali is come to its purer state .

It is urged further , that a person , being only for a short time exposed to really putrid exhalations , may be infected with putrid diseases ; and therefore that this effect of putrid exhalations does not depend on the volatile alcali , as it may be taken pure in very large doses , without producing such effects .	To this I reply , by an analogous instance ; a small quantity of ferment will bring on fermentation in a large mass of fermentable matter , and yet as much acid as could be obtained from the ferment , far from exciting an intestine motion in the fermentable matter , would rather check it ; but can it , for all that , be denied , that the involved acid in the ferment is the chief cause of setting the whole mass in fermentation ? In the same way , the alcali combined with phlogistic matter may produce such intestine motion as the pure alcali cannot ; and very likely the first would not produce it , if the volatile alcali in it could be changed .

Possibly , however , it may suffer such a semi - fusion , or softening of the whole mass , as takes place in clay when exposed to an intense heat ; for when the bit used happened to have cracks , it separated during its contraction , at these cracks , and the parts receded from each other without falling asunder .

It has no smell nor taste .	Its specific gravity is considerably above that of water , though from the minute state of division in which it exists , it usually takes a considerable time to subside in that fluid .

Here grows the Radix Serpentaria Nigra , which was so much used in the last great pestilence , that the price of it advanced from ten Shillings to three pounds sterling a pound : Here is also an herb which some call Dittany , others Pepper - wort ; it is not Dittany ofCandia , nor English Dittander ; it grows a foot or a foot and half high , the leaves are about the breadth of a groat , and figured like a heart , and short out of the stalk and branches one of a side directly opposite to each other ; it smells hot like Pepper , and bites upon the Tongue .	The water of this herb distilled out of a Limbeck , is one of the best things I know to drive worms out of the Body ; and an ounce of this water taken , provokes sweat plentifully .

Unlike other pestilential , putrid , or malignant fevers , it bears all the characteristic symptoms , progress , crisis , and event of the small - pox ; and , whether received by contagion or inoculation , has the same appearances , stages , and determination , except more favourably by inoculation , and with this distinctive and decisive property , that a beast having had the sickness , naturally or artificially , never has it a second time .

When this resin is exposed to a higher temperature it swells , gives off the odour of naphtha ( ? ) , and the porous mass , when cold , is no longer soft but brittle .	Analysed in this state it gave the formula ( C40 i31 03 ) , but I did not ascertain how much foreign matter this specimen contained , and the coincidence of the result with this formula may be accidental .

I must also give them Notice , that by the length of the Disease , they will be disordered in their Head , have a Hiccup and a Vomiting , with a Pain in the lower Belly , accompanied with Stools resembling the Dregs of Wine , or the Washings of Meat , smelling like Carrion , and it will be better to let them alone , for these are sure Marks that the Gangrene is already in their Bowels .	As for all others sick of a Dysentery , they need but to observe the following Rules , and they will be cured easily : First , they must take for Three Days together , Morning and Evening , one of the Papers of Powder marked with A , diluted with half a Glass of Wine , and as much Water , to dispose them by Degrees for Purging , and to sweeten and correct the sharp corrosive Humours , which are of the Nature of Aqua Fortis , and the Spirit of Nitre , and which eat away the Tunicles of the Intestines , and the Mouths of the Vessels , from whence it comes to pass , that from a single Looseness they often fall into a Dysentery , because those depraved Humours become sharp and corrosive , and the Malady augments every Day ; so that to make a sure Cure , we must begin by destroying the Sharpness and Malignity of those Humours , which is done by this First Remedy .

The water had remained in the laboratory unattended to ; but after an interval of some weeks it was observed to have become clear , while nearly the whole of the former sediment had risen to the surface , forming a stratum of half an inch in thickness , and still emitting a very offensive odour .	In process of time this sculm separated into large masses or flakes , with minute air - bubbles attached to them .

ro6951	smell	of the Bark									Each assumed a deep purple colour , scarcely perceptibly different in degree ; though I thought the infusion , after standing a while , acquired rather a more dusky purple than the decoction .	The infusion had a deeper tinge , and more of the taste and smell of the Bark in substance than the decoction .	Its taste indeed exactly resembled the Bark , after it had been broke down and chewed for some time in the mouth .

This infusion was found to have the smell and taste of the Bark , in a considerable greater degree than either the decoction or infusion without trituration of Experiment I .	and it assumed a much blacker colour , on the admixture of one dram of the chalybeate solution , than either of the two former preparations .

To equal quantities of this , and of the two decoctions mentioned above , one dram of the chalybeate solution was added ; the black tinge was manifestly weakest in this decoction , though the difference was not so great as might have been expected , from the diversity in their sensible qualities of taste and smell ; owing perhaps to the fine powder of the Bark , which floated in it , and retained some degree of its original astringency .

The smell of the Bark was almost entirely covered in both the infusions , which were strongly impregnated with the lime ; and had an extremely disagreeable flavour .	The first was of a pale colour , and possessed but a slight degree of bitterness ; the latter had a deeper tinge , and was equally bitter and nauseous .

Neither of them struck a black colour with the chalybeate solution , which , as soon as it was added , occasioned a yellow sediment , that in a few hours subsided to the bottom of the glass .
ro6951	aroma	of the Bark		this							That moderate heat promotes and assists the action of water , as a menstruum on the Bark , is evident from the IXth Experiment ; and it would be of advantage to determine , what degree of heat this drug will admit of , without suffering a decomposition .	It should however be remarked , that this infusion though stronger , had neither so agreeable a flavour , nor was so sensibly impregnated with the aroma of the Bark , as the two made with cold water .	In an essay on the dissolvent power of quick - lime , a very ingenious chemist has observed , that all resinous bodies become soluble in water , when the cohesion of their particles is destroyed , by withdrawing the fixed air which they contain .

In one instance , in which fluate of potassa had been heated in a platina tray and tube , in which muriate of potassa had been fused , for the purpose of defending the interior , as much as possible , from the action of the fluoric principle , the gas , when disengaged into the atmosphere , had a peculiar smell , different from that of chlorine , ( which certainly formed the greatest proportion of the elastic matter , ) and more disagreeable ; and dense white fumes were produced by its action upon the air .	A portion of this gas thrown into a glass receiver , over mercury , acted upon the glass , and silicated fluoric acid gas was generated .

When burnt , the colloid acid chars , emitting a pungent and irritating smell , and after complete combustion , nothing but the minutest trace of inorganiic residue remains .	Although strictly a colloid , this acid in the free state passes through a dialyzer , but not so readily as a crystalloid .
ro6992	smell	of chlorine	slightest								DULONG ' S two methods of ascertaining the quantity of chlorine in the sublimate , appear to me at least as objectionable as his process for determining the composition of phosphoric acid , and liable to great errors : the first from the uncertainty of the absolute quantity of chlorine admitted ; and the second , from the loss arising from the vapour of the sublimate , which must be carried off by the current of chlorine .	How great a deficiency may originate from the last circumstance , is shown by the following experiment : 5 grains of phosphorus were converted into sublimate by chlorine in great excess , the remaining chlorine was displaced by passing common air through the vessel for some time , till not the slightest smell of chlorine could be perceived ; the retort was then weighed , and a current of air passed through it .	Though this current could hardly have replaced the air contained in the retort , yet the loss of weight was 1 .

Upon opening one of them , we found a small Quantity of a dark brown Liquor like Tar , of the Consistence of a thick Syrup , which smelt exactly like Castor , and had a Sort of Pungency like Spirit of Hart ' s - horn , which the dried Castor doth not retain .	It is very probable that the Youth of our Animal was the Reason why these Bags were not sull ; and that the Castor itself was not of that soft resinous Consistence as mentioned by Dr .

From the Structure of these Glands , and their Connection with the Bags , I conclude , that the Castor is secreted in these Glands , where it is fluid like Oil , light - colour ' d , and hardly having any Smell ; that it runs down into the Bags , which serve as Receptacles to collect a large Quantity together for the Use of the Beaver , and that in these Receptacles it loses its thinner Parts , becomes more inspissate , of an higher Colour , and of a stronger Scent , much in the same manner as the Gall in the Gall - Bladder , which there becomes so different from what it was in the Liver .	It is certain that Ducks , Geese , and all sorts of Water - Fowl , have a Gland in their Rump , from which they express with their Bill an oily Matter , and with it anoint or dress their Feathers , to prevent their being soaked by the Water in which they swim ; and the Glands of that large Sort of Duck commonly called the Muscovy - Duck , or more properly the Musk - Duck , afford such an Oil , as sweet - scented as Civet : I therefore think it probable , as the Beaver is an Animal , which frequents the Water as much as those Water - Fowls , that the Castor is a Substance provided by Nature for him to greese and anoint his Fur with , to prevent the Water from soaking quite to his Skin : and as the Castor is impregnated with penetrating pungent Particles , it may likewise contribute to keep off the Cold and Chill which the Water might otherwise strike to his Body , by remaining a long time in it .

Now , if the smaller and more subtle matter , which we shall henceforth called Vinous Spirits , being pressed by heat , carry up and convey along with them some entire unbroken Oily parts , or receive them that are capable of being elevated with the same degree of heat by which they were raised ; these mixtures will retain somewhat of the most remarkable differences in Taste , and sometimes Odour , whereby the Vegetables themselves on their Oils were discriminated : But upon long frequent Digestions , or reiterated Distillations , these gross Oreaginous particles are either subdivided , and thereby become Vinous spirits , or that gentle equal degree of heat , which is sufficient to elevate the more active volatil Vinous spirits , cannot raise the more sluggish Oils ; so that the Results are pure single homogeneous Vinous spirits , which , whatsoever the Concretes were from whence they were derived , though vastly differing from each other , as also their Oils , out of which the Vinous spirits were more immediately produced ; yet the Spirits themselves thus purified are in Outward appearance similar , and perhaps as perfectly simple and homogeneous , as most substances in the Universe .	What I have delivered , is further confirmed by a more visible palpable Conversion of Vegetable Oils into Vinous Spirits ; which I have effected in many , and , by Analogous operations , I presume , the same change may be superinduced upon all .

The other Experiment concerning Volatil Salts succeeded after this manner ; Having occasion for Volatil Urinous Spirits for some ordinary uses , I mixed equal parts of Sal Armoniac and Pot - ashes , which latter had a very strong sulphureous smell , yet did seem to abound with Salt , and that considerably Alcalized .	The mixture being put into a tall Glass - body , immediately upon its feeling the heat , plenty of a Volatil Salt sublimed , from which I expected no unusual appearance , having often repeated this operation without observing any circumstance which deserved peculiar attention .

Springing from about the middle of the anterior border , and from the upper surface of these , is a pair of ganglia corresponding to the pedunculate pair , which in Eolis we have called olfactory .	In Doris they are almost sessile , and though in size much inferior to the cerebroid , are nevertheless of notable dimnensions .
ro7085	olfactory	The single|visceral ganglion									Three large nerves , the thirteenth , fourteenth and fifteenth pairs are given off from these centres and supply the whole foot .	The single supra - oesophageal or visceral ganglion * is round , and about the size of the olfactory ; it is sessile on the under surface of the anterior border of the right branchial ganglion , where this is in contact with the pedial The nerves g , h , , j issue from this ganglion ; ( g ) the first in origin passes down by the side of the aorta , to which it gives branches ; one of these has a small ganglion ( n ) in its course ; the other , the larger , passes further on , and ends in two or three ganglia ( p ) placed at the root of the aorta , which send branches to the pericardiumn and heart .	The trunk of the nerve passes down towards the branchiae , and in so doing , gives off next another branch to the systemic heart , and then a large offset to the portal heart ; after this the nerve comes into connection with the branchial ganglia and plexus ( q ) of the sympathetic system , and communicates with the renal plexus ( v ) , apparently a dependence of the former or branchial .

Secondly , we have the large anterior supra - oesophageal or sensorial or cerebroid ganglia supplying the lips and channel of the mouth with both motor and sensitive nerves , and not only supplying the olfactory , but also the optic ganglia and the auditory capsules .	This second pair is clearly comparable to either the hemispherical ganglia or the centres of sensation and volition , or to both these sets together , with a portion of the anterior extremity of the spinal cord , and probably also the cerebellum .

When they go in Troops , if one of them perceives an Herb on which any Man has trampled , he pulls it up , and delivers it to the next , who smells it and gives it to a third , and so on till it come to the last , who makes a great Noise , upon which all go to flight , and retire to Hills , Mountains , Shady , and other less frequented Places , where when there is no more Grass , some dig up Roots , others go and pull tender Buds , Herbs and Leaves of Trees ; and the first that finds any thing , returns and convenes the rest of the Flock , that he may communicate to them what he has purchased .

That this Animal has a very subtle Blood , abounding with a penetrating Urinous Salt ; which he proves from the Vivacity of the Species , from the Urinous Effluvia which affected his Nostrils , and from the smarting of his Finger by the Blood , after it was cut .	As to the first , that it is a very Vivacious and Spirituous Animal , both the foregoing Relation and the Account of all Authors make it apparent ; but that does not hinder its Blood from being incrassated by Cold and bad Diet , nor that these Scabs may proceed from this gross Blood .

As to the second , tho ' he might have been sensible of an abounding Urinous Salt in that Animal , it does not follow it should be so in all , and I am apt to believe it was extraordinary ; for without doubt such a burning as the poor Beast underwent , even to its Death , must have altered the Constitution of its Blood , and made it quite different from what it was ; and it is probable , that it was at such places , as were most affected with the Burning , where he felt this Urinous Smell , and the smarting of his Finger .	For my part , I observed the Blood of this Subject to be Styp ick and estringent : So that when my Hands were imbru ' d in it , I could scarce bend a Finger ; which Effect I have also perceived at the Dissection of Fishes , which all acknowledge to have viscuous Blood .

ro7122	smell	their Belly									As to the circular Fibres spoken of by Dr .	Moulins , I do not know I saw any , neither do I think them necessary for pulling up the Trunk , or deminishing it as to its length : For the great distance betwixt the Origin of these Muscles , and their Insertion at the Extremity of the Trunk , the longitudinal Position of their Fibres till they come to make a part of it , and the space they have to act it , and to smell their Belly , and their oblique Insertion in these tendinous Lines , may be looked upon as sufficient to perform this motion ; and it is observable for this end , that the Skin is divided into several Plicae or Links , as we see in a Worm , when she draws up and shortens herself .	Thus I conceive the forenam ' d Fasciculi may at the beginning extremely begin to be contracted , then the Fasciculi next to them , and so in order till they come to the Root of the Trunk ; by which successive Contractions the Bellies of all the Muscles begin to swell , and so their Fibres diminish as to their length : And there needs no more for stretching forth the Proboscis thus contracted , but the Fibres to resile to their former Position ; which it may do with the same swiftness , as we see a Bow doth by its Elasticity when once it is shot .

This Hole is not so considerable in Human Subjects , but larger in Quadrupeds , especially Its Blood ally such as feed upon Grass or Hay ; insomuch , that by the bigness of this Branch of the 5th Pair in an Ox or Hart , we may reasonably conjecture they have a partial Taste , and a most acute Smell by the Upper Lip , the better to enable them to chuse their Food : For at the Dissection of a Calfs Head , you ' ll perceive both this Nerve and the Blood Vessels much bigger than what might be thought requisite for furnishing either Blood or Spirits to this part , were there not some extraordinary use for both .

ro7123	Scent	of the Balsam									I Have been mightily persuaded by several Gentlemen to send you the following Observations , together with the enclosed Figures , if perhaps they may be of use to such as are troubled with Shortness of Breath .	Some time before the King went for England , I had frequent Discourse with a certain Physician about the Curing of Shortness of Breath ; who tole me , that he was well acquainted with all the sorts of Balsam that were esteemed useful in that Disease , but that it was impossible to find any Vehicle that could insinuate them effectually into the Lungs , and that in vain do they anoint the Breast and Stomach with Balsams that could never reach the Lungs , and that the Scent of the Balsam which exhaled from those that used to anoint their Breast with Oil , does not exhale from the Pipes of the Lungs , but was evaporated from the Breast by the Neck .	I was also persuaded of the Truth of this Assertion , because I am convinced that nothing that is in the Stomach or Bowels can be conveyed to the Lungs , unless it has first past thro the Heart ; and consequently much less can Balsams , sams wherewith we anoint our Breasts , find any Passage into the Lungs .

I have often thought with my self too , that these Balsams , or at least some Cordial Gums , Herbs or Juices , are not only good against Shortness of Breath , but also will preserve the Lungs from cold stinking Mist , and Pesti lential Airs , I have been told , that the best Balsam for Shortness of Breath is the Balsam of Peru , which I never saw , neither did I intend to make the above - mentioned Instrument a Vehicle for Balsams , for I freely own , I have no skill of Balsams of Gums or Herbs , only this I have often experienced , that stinking smells arc prejudical to my Lungs .	I do n ' t design to invite any body to make use of the said Tube , besides I have presented it to an able Physician , who is well versed in those Balsams , Gums , and Juices , that are good for the Lungs .

There is strong experimental evidence that the compound from which clay liberates sulphide of hydrogen is not the sulphurized naphthalin one ; for if hydrogen be passed through a vessel containing this substance , then through clay , and subsequently over lead - paper , no trace of sulphide of hydrogen is found , though the gas passing smells strongly of impure naphthalin .

From these two instances it is clear that some , or perhaps all , of the volatile hydrocarbons in gas possess the power of upholding tar with them in their vapours ; and it is proved that this tar is no inconsiderable source of the sulphurous acid produced by the combustion of gas as at present purified .

ro7156	odour		phosplhoric				MULLER|we				In like manner , if the electric current be passed for a short distance only along a sensory nerve , it will excite in the sensoriurn the peculiar sensations ordinarily produced by impressions conveyed through that nerve ; that is to say , the ordinary tactile sensations , if the current be transmitted along a nerve of common sensation ; or those of sight , hearing , smell , or taste , if the current be transmitted along the optic , auditory , olfactive , or gustative nerves .	And thus , as remarked by MULLER , we may , by proper management , be made conscious at one and the same time of pricking sensations , of flashes of light , of a phosplhoric odour , and of a peculiar taste ; 74 ' 2 all excited by a peculiar cause , the transmission of an electric current along the sensory nerves , through which these modes of consciousness are respectively excited .	This production of muscular contraction on the one hand , and of various forms of sensation on the otler , by the transmission of an electric current through a nervetrunk , along a short distance only , appear to indicate that it is to the nervous force called into activity by the electric , and not to the electric force itself , that the phenomena are immediately due ; and so strong an analogy presents itself between this development of nerve - force in a nerve , and the development of the magnetic force in a piece of iron , as the immediate and direct result of a certain application of the electric current , that , whatever may be the view taken of the relation of the magnetic force to the electric , the relation of the nervous force to the electric can scarcely but be placed in the same category .

It was remarkable , that the Floor of the Chamber was so thick smeared with a gluish Moisture , that it could not be taken off ; and the Stink spread more and more through the other Chambers .

It seems also , that it was not what is commonly taken for a Fulmen ; for there was not left in the Place any sulphureous and nitrous Smell : There did not appear any blackish Tracks on the Walls ; all Signs of the Fulmina , as they have been remarked by the exactest Observer of Phenomenon , the celebrated Mr .

The Author relates , That , going once out of Curiosity into a Sulphur Mine by Montefiascone , when near the Place from whence the Miners dug out the Sulphur , he was advised by one of them , who was carrying out his Load , not to go farther ; for , either the Smell , or some sudden Exhalation , might have done him great Injury ; and when got again in the open Air , told him , a few Days before three of his Fellow Miners fell stone - dead , while they were at Work , by a violent Suffocation , caused by a strong Exhalation of bituminous Smoke , which burst violently from the Place where they were digging ; which Misfortune was too frequent in such Mines ; but he never heard nor saw , that any of them had been burnt .

The Author relates , That , going once out of Curiosity into a Sulphur Mine by Montefiascone , when near the Place from whence the Miners dug out the Sulphur , he was advised by one of them , who was carrying out his Load , not to go farther ; for , either the Smell , or some sudden Exhalation , might have done him great Injury ; and when got again in the open Air , told him , a few Days before three of his Fellow Miners fell stone - dead , while they were at Work , by a violent Suffocation , caused by a strong Exhalation of bituminous Smoke , which burst violently from the Place where they were digging ; which Misfortune was too frequent in such Mines ; but he never heard nor saw , that any of them had been burnt .	Thence it is concluded , that if the Fulmina have such an Effect , the Incendium proceeds originally from their nitrous , and not from their sulphureous Parts ; because the Air , very closely imprisoned in the Nitre , and not in the Sulphur , either by its own Elasticity , or by some other Agent being put in Agitation , produces the Flame of the Fulmen , which burns and consumes any thing to Ashes .

Nay , on the contrary , if there was a Mine of Sulphur , one should smell the Stink of it in those dull Days , when the nauseous South Wind blows ; the Sulphur Mines then stinking at a great Distance : Besides , the Effects of Sulphur are not to reduce a Body into impalpable Ashes .

For it is most probably owing merely to albumen or gelatine not essential to the colouring particles , and much more rapidly decomposed .

Exposure to strong daylight and to sunlight , either in the open air or in confined spaces for a few days ( two to four ) , developes in the gun - cotton a very faint aromatic odour ; and if litmus - paper be allowed to remain in close contact with the confined material , it acquires a rose - coloured tinge similar to that produced by carbonic acid , and recovers its original colour after brief exposure to air .	If , after exposure to light in open air for some days , the gun - cotton be placed in the dark , in cases which are not airtight , the odour becomes gradually fainter , and the effect upon litmus - paper slighter ; if the packages containing the gun - cotton are air - tight , the odour and action upon litmus do not increase during storage for several years ( the actual experience gained at Woolwich extends over nearly four years ) .

If the gun - cotton be exposed for protracted periods to daylight with free access of air , it speedily loses all odour and power of affecting litmus .	If exposure to diffused daylight in confined spaces be continued , the first results of the action of light are , of course , retained ; but up to the present time no single indication of their increase has been observed ; indeed , the very faint acid reaction described , which was developed at first , has frequently disappeared , probably in consequence of the neutralizing action of small quantities of earthy carbonates contained in the gun - cotton .

The acidity gradually becomes more manifest ; the odour increases , and becomes in time somewhat pungent and indicative of the presence of very small quantities of nitrous acid ; and litmus - paper , if confined in the vessel with gun - cotton thus exposed , becomes entirely bleached after two or three months .	Although specimens of gun - cotton always undergo some spontaneous change under these very special circumstances , the decomposition proceeds with extreme slowness ; and the results of the observations instituted by me are , therefore , in this respect quite at variance with those recently published by DE LUCA , who states that the specimens operated upon by him decomposed upon exposure to sunlight , some on the first day of the experiment , others after several days ' exposure .

The gun - cotton was found to have a powerful acid reaction and a somewhat pungent odour , its fibre had become tender , but its explosiveness had not sustained any important diminution .	The aqueous solution yielded upon evaporation only a very small amorphous residue , which consisted partly of alkaline and earthy salts derived from the gun - cotton .

The effects upon this specimen of more than one year ' s exposure in a confined space to strong daylight , frequent sunlight , and considerable heat radiated from the wall during the summer months , were as follows : the gun - cotton had a somewhat pungent odour , in which , however , nitrous acid could not be recognized ; its reaction was decidedly , though not powerfully , acid ; the strength of its fibre and its explosiveness had not become affected .	By exhaustion with boiling water it furnished a somewhat acid liquid , which contained a very small quantity of organic matter ; a yellowish tinge was imparted to it by addition of potassic hydrate , but it did not reduce cupric salts .

The specimen had only a very faint odour , its explosiveness and strength had not undergone any appreciable change ; water extracted only 03 per cent .	of soluble matter ; a trace of nitric acid was detected in the extract , but no oxalic acid and no reaction upon cupric salts could be obtained .

It had not altered in appearance , but was found to be strongly acid to test - paper ; it had a peculiar pungent odour , the fibre had become tender , and its explosiveness had diminished somewhat .	A portion of the specimen was washed thoroughly , first in distilled water and afterwards in slightly alkaline water , then dried and placed in a bottle , in which it has been exposed to diffused light for three years without undergoing further change .

Some parts of the litmus paper enclosed in the latter had assumed a pink tinge , and where it had been placed between the gun - cotton and the metal surface of the packing case , it was decidedly 2KE2 reddened in spots ; the tin surface , moreover , exhibited slight signs of oxidation in some places where it was in very close contact with the gun - cotton * .

At the expiration of the month , the litmus paper was found to be reddened , and the gun - cotton had a somewhat pungent odour .	A portion of it , extracted with a small quantity of cold water , furnished a very faintly acid liquid , which , upon being kept in a covered vessel for some hours , was found upon the following day to be distinctly alkaline .

They all unite to the acid with a considerable effervesence , and discharge plenty of vapours , which smell strongly of the volatile sulphureous acid , and which are not at all inflammable .	Iron is not sensibly acted on by this acid , without the assistance of heat ; but zinc and tin are in some measure acted on by it , while cold .
ro7348	fumes|smell	the nitrous|their	more penetrating						during the solution		The volatile sulphureous fumes , produced by uniting these metallic substances by heat to the undiluted vitriolic acid , show plainly , that in this case their phlogiston unites to the acid ; for it is well known , that the vitriolic sulphureous acid consists of the plain vitriolic acid united to phlogiston * .	It is highly probable too , that the same thing happens in dissolving these metallic substances in the nitrous acid ; as the fumes produced during the solution appear plainly to consist in great measure of the nitrous acid , and yet it appears , from their more penetrating smell and other reasons , that the acid must have undergone some change in its nature , which can hardly be attributed to any thing else than its union with the phlogiston .	As to the inflammable air , produced by dissolving these substances in spirit of salt or the diluted vitriolic acid , there is great reason to think , that it does not contain any of the acid in its composition ; not only because it seems to be just the same whichsoever of these acids it is produced by ; but also because there is an inflammable air , seemingly much of the same kind as this , produced from animal substances in putrefaction , and from vegetable substances in distillation , as will be shown hereafter ; though there can be no reason to suppose , that this kind of inflammable air owes its production to any acid .
ro7348	smell	the solution	near so strong		the spirits of sal ammoniac						The reason , why the mixture of the solution of volatile sal ammoniac , with the spirits of sal ammoniac made with lime , precipitates the magnesia from the Epsom salt , is that , as the spirits made with lime contain no fixed air , the mixture of these spirits with the solution of volatile sal ammoniac contains less air in proportion to the quantity of acid which it can saturate , than the solution of volatile sal ammoniac by itself does .	Volatile sal ammoniac requires a great deal of water to dissolve it , and the solution has not near so strong a smell as the spirits of sal ammoniac made with fixed alcali ; the reason of which is , that the latter contain much less fixed air .	But volatile sal ammoniac dissolves in considerable quantity in weak spirits of sal ammoniac made with lime , and the solution differs in no respect from the spirits made with fixed alcali .

C .	, but the smell of methylamine was always perceptible , and the more so the longer the time of heating ; this was found to be due to the partial decomposition of the cotarnine .	On opening a tube where all the narcotine had disappeared , the yellow liquid was found to be strongly alkaline , and on being acidified with hydrochloric acid , deposited crystals of meconin on cooling after evaporation .

A portion of narcotine was cautiously heated to 205 ? - 208 ? , and the heat withdrawn when the decomposition was just commencing ; on extracting the mass with hot water , a liquor was obtained from which meconin crystallized out on cooling , identified by its peculiar physical characteristics ; the other products of decomposition could not be isolated .

When the Flustrafoliacea was exposed to a low red heat , in a crucible , it emitted a smell like burned horn , but retained its shape , by reason of the carbonate of lime with which it was coated .	The Flustra thus burned , when dissolved in dilute nitric acid , deposited some animal coal ; but , tin other respects , the present solution resembled the former nitric solution of this substance when in a recent state .

Some of the Corallina Opuntia was then exposed to a low red heat , in a crucible ; it emitted a smell of burned horn , and in great measure retained its shape , evidently from the calcareous coating .	The ' burned coralline , being dissolved in dilute nitric acid , deposited some animal coal .
ro7367	smell	of burned horn									A great quantity of smoke was emitted , .	which had the smell of burned horn ; and , after a few minutes , the branch separated at the knotty joints , into as many pieces as there were joints in the branch .	These ' joints had all the characters of coral ; but the whole of the membrane which had invested them , as well as the knotted protuberances by which they had been connected , were destroyed , by being converted into coal .

When put into dilute nitric acid , a solution was made , with effervescence , during which , there was a copious deposition of animal coal .
ro7367	smell	of burned horn	faint					during about ten minutes at which time			It may here be observed , that in each of the above related experiments , the red colour of the coral was gradually destroyed , as the solution of the calcareous substance advanced , and could not afterwards by any means be restored ; nor could any colouring principle whatever be detected by the re - agents usually employed .	A piece of red coral , in its natural or uncoated state , was exposed to a low red heat , in a crucible , during about ten minutes at which time a faint smell of burned horn .	was to be perceived .
ro7367	smell	it			like burned horn				When burned in a crucible		The stem , on the contrary , when thus treated , afforded much phosphate of lime , and very little of the carbonate .	When burned in a crucible , it smoked , and emitted a smell like burned horn , but the figure was notdestroyed ; and , when afterwards dissolved in the acid , it yielded the same products as before .	Gorgonia Flabellum .
ro7367	smell				like horn that is burned						The same pieces were afterwards boiled with lixivium of caustic potash , which effected a perfect solution , and formed the animal soap of CHAPTAL ; at the same time , the calcareous matter subsided to the bottom of , the mattress .	The cortical part of this Gorgonia , when put into a red - hot crucible , emitted much smoke , with a smell like horn that is burned ; after this , it fell into pieces , which , being dissolved in nitric acid , afforded a small portion of phosphate of lime , and a large quantity of carbonate of lime .	When the stern of this Gorgonia was steeped during 14 or iS days in dilute nitric acid , it tinged it with pale yellow .

When the stem of this Gorgonia was exposed to a red heat in a retort , or crucible , it curled up , and smelled like burned horn ; after which , a spongy coal remained , of difficult incineration .	By a long continuation of the heat , a residuum was left , so small as scarcely to be collected , which , being dissolved in dilute nitric acid , afforded , by the addition of ammoniac , a slight precipitate of phosphate of lime .

When this Gorgonza was exposed to a red heat , it emitted much smoke , with a smell of burned horn : it soon lost its shape , puffed up , and formed a spongy coal , which , by a long continued heat , left a few : particles of a ; & gt ; white substance , consisting chiefly of muriate of soda .	Another : species of Gorgonia was next examined , the stem of which is from one quarter to nearly half of an inch in diameter in the thickest parts ; of a black colour , and - a high polish , like black sealing wax : it has probably been consideredas a variety of Gorgoia Antzpathes .
ro7367	smell	of burned horn							When this Gorgonia was exposed to a red heat		Ammoniac being added , changed it to a deep yellow or orange colour ; but the transparency of the liquor was not disturbed by this , or any of the other precipitants which had been employed in the former experiments .	When this Gorgonia was exposed to a red heat , it crackled , and emitted a , thick smoke , with the smell of burned horn .	The shape was soon destroyed , and a compact coal remained .
ro7367	smell	of burned horn									Part of a large branch of this Gorgonia was exposed to a low red heat .	It immediately emitted a thick smoke , with the smell of burned horn ; and , after a long continued heat , the phosphate of lime was left , so as to retain the original figure , like bone which has been burned ; but , in the present instance , the particles of the mass cohered but feebly .	When this residuum was dissolved , and the phosphate separated in the usual manner , a slight cloud of carbonate of limewas produced by potash .
ro7367	smell								When exposed to heat		As the above properties prove that Sponges only differ from the horny stems of the Gorgonixe , and from the Antipatbes , by being of a finer and more closely woven texture , t so this similarity will be corroborated by the , following remarks .	When exposed to heat , they yielded the same products , the same smell , and afforded a similar coal , which by incineration left a very small residuum , consisting chiefly of muriate of soda , occasionally mixed with some carbonate of lime , which was also often discovered when the recent Sponges were immersed in acids ; but this , as well as the muriate of soda , is I believe merely extraneous , and arises from small shells , parts of Madrepores , and such like bodies , which are often visibly lodged in the interstices of the Sponges .	Lastly , the Sponges , when boiled with lixiviumn of caustic potash , were completely dissolved , and , like the horny stems of the Gorgonki , formed animal soap , more especially when the part which is apparently insoluble in water , and which remains after the gelatin has been separated , was thus treated .

T7o this also , many be added , that the water in which tortoiseshell , nail , and albumen , had been boiled , became in some measure putrid in a few .	days , and emitted an offensive smell .

This last substance also , when merely coagulated , does not easily putrefy ; for I kept it , when it was soft , white , and coagulated , in water , during the whole of the month of last April , without finding that it became really putrid : towards the - latter part of the time , it had rather a disagreeable smell ; still , however , it was far from being absolutely putrid .	But albumen which has not been coagulated , or which has been diluted and shaken with a quantity of cold water , begins in a very few days to be putrid ; liquid albumen , therefore , enters easily into putrefaction , although it is the reverse with that which is dense and solid : and , from a comparison of the preceding experiments upon tortoise - shell , quill , nail , & amp ; c .

ro7367	smell	it	musty|putrid								* Muscular fibre , when prepared as already mentioned , so as ( by long maceration , and subsequent boiling , with frequent change of water ) to be very nearly deprived of the whole of its gelatinous part , is not easily brought into the putrid state .	A small quantity was kept moistened with water , during the whole of last April ; in the course of which time , it acquired a - musty but not a putrid smell ; neither were the fibres reduced to a pulpy mass .	* I am inclined therefore to suspect , that strong and completely formed muscular fibre , considered as a distinct substance , is not of easy putrescibility ; and that the readiness with which muscle in general enters into putrefaction , is principally owing to the gelatin , which is combined and mixed with it , in a large proportion , as a component part , and which , with the natural quantity of moisture , is requisite to give the fibre a .
ro7375	Smell								after the Oil is evapoured by an intense Heat		I formerly declared , that most Vegetables , burnt whilst green or moist , and with a smothering Fire , yield a kind of a Neutral Salt , which may be called Tartareous , and sometimes not improperly Essential , many of them retaining the Vomitive , Purging , Sweating , Diuretical , Opiate , or other general , and perhaps some specifical Properties , wherewith the Plants were enobled which produced them .	Now , whether it is some small Quantity of the Essential Oil , which mixed with the Saline Principle , renders it so variously Medicinal , the Essential Oils of Plants being manifestly as ' twere a Compendium of the Plant , which they do equally exactly resemble in Smell , Taste , and other Qualities : Or , whether those Virtues are the result of the crasis and mixture of the several Principles ; certain I am , that , after the Oil is evapoured by an intense Heat , or the Crasis disturbed by avolation of some Parts , and new Combinations of what remains , farewel all Specifical Qualities , and consequently all other Differences , than what Purity and Impurity , and several degrees of heat may occasion ; some being more white and fiery than others .	Now , some Salts are much more easily deprived of their Acid and Oily Parts than others ; and in some , on the contrary , the Oil is of so fixed a Nature , or rather so closely combined with the other Principles , that it must be a very intense Heat which can disjoin them , and thereby reduce the Salt to the common standard or aggregate of Qualities , wherein all Alcalies agree .
ro7380	odours	of volatile hydrocarbons|they|their	peculiar								The Ozone thus formed , if not instantly evolved from the plant , would be destroyed by the easily oxidizable carboncompounds present .	It is more probable , however , that the Ozone , stated by DE LUCA and others to be observable in the vicinity of vegetation , is due to the intense action of the oxygen of the air upon the minute quantities of volatile hydrocarbons emitted by the plants , and to which they owe their peculiar odours , than to any action going on within the cells .	The rapidity of the oxidation in the air of the hydrocarbons , and the volatile principles of plants generally , goes to favour the view here suggested ; so also does the fact , that Ozone has been observed most readily in the vicinity of such plants as are known to emit freely essential oils - - as , for instance , those of the Labiate family , 494 Since it would appear that , under certain circumstances , Ozone is formed in the immediate vicinity of some plants , it remains to consider the possibility of its acting , in an indirect manner , as a source of combined Nitrogen to our experimental plants - that is , through the agency of the materials involved in the experiment - and thus compromising our result in regard to the question of the appropriation , by the plant itself , of free or uncombined Nitrogen .

ro7380	odour	of Ozone	distinct			in the room			whilst the air was passing		Once every three or four days a small piece of phosphorus was dropped into each balloon .	In this way the action was sufficiently maintained to produce a distinct odour of Ozone in the room whilst the air was passing .	During the first half of the period of the experiment , a wash - bottle filled with large lumps of pumice , and about half - full of a solution of caustic potash , was used ; so that the ozonized air in bubbling rapidly through the solution continually threw it up , by which means the pumice was kept moistened with it .

After the first day the gas possessed a more or less disagreeable taste , and the odour of decomposing organic matter .	The following statement of the condition of the several mixtures , at the termination of the experiment , is condensed from the notes then made : 1 .

ro7380	odour	of decomposing organic matter		the air drawn through the bottle				In a few days			- The Pumice in this case was covered with water to the depth of about one - fourth of an inch , and a few grains floated in the water .	In a few days the air drawn through the bottle gave the odour and taste of decomposing organic matter .	At the end of about a month the free water on the surface began to disappear rapidly , and in a short time it was all gone , leaving a grey mouldy coating of organic matter over the top of the pumice .

By the end of February the bottle was quite filled with green vegetable matter , and up to that time no odour of decomposition was distinguishable in the air which was passed through , but from that date the leaves became yellow , and decomposition has been manifested both by appearance and the taste of the air .

ro7380	odour		foul disagreeable|so intense		that of the corresponding Barley						In both the above cases with Wheat , the supernatant water was colourless , but in this it had a dirty , muddy , yellowish colour .	The mass emitted a foul disagreeable odour , though not so intense as that of the corresponding Barley .	Barley ( a ) - Seeds , in Soil with 50 cutb .

They emitted very little odour , which was not unpleasant .	There can be no question as to the absence of any evolution of free Nitrogen during the long period that these three descriptions of seed were under experiment .
ro7383	smell	it	strong								As to the alkaline solution , which Vauquelin considered as containing a portion of oxide of chrome , it is observed , that though some kinds of platina may contain chrome , and of course exhibit a certain quantity of it in its black powder , yet the precipitate which , upon accurate investigation , is yielded by it affords a very volatile metallic oxide , which evidently has not the characteristic qualities of that metal .	As it is expedient to assign a specific name to every new substance , our author wishes to distinguish this precipitate by the appellation of Osmium , from the strong smell it emits .	After showing in what manner it may be expelled from the alkali by an acid , and obtained by solution with water and distillation , the author mentions many of its relative properties and characteristic qualities .
ro7389	fragrance|odour	it	pleasing|totally different|nauseous								In a short time the compound was decomposed , the aldehyde floating on the surface in the form of an oil .	The aldehyde thus procured was colourless ; it possessed a pleasing fragrance , totally different from the nauseous odour of the plant itself .	Its boiling - point , as first prepared , fluctuated considerably , arising partly from oxidation and consequent formation of other bodies , and partly from the presence of a small portion of another aldehyde .

It would appear that this last operation ( supposed by him to yield an isomeric modification of the capric aldehyde ) was in fact to some extent a process of purification , the liquid so prepared having a fruity odour , different from the oil merely purified by distillation , and therefore resembling the pure and fragrant aldehyde obtained by me .	Although the experiments detailed scarcely permit a doubt of the true nature of the substance ( especially when the mode of purification is considered ) , still it was wished to place the matter beyond dispute .

The Blood , which came from them , was Watery , Salt , and Corrosive ; and the Stink , which came from their Mouth , was intolerable .	They had hard blew Spots on their Legs and Thighs , frequent Haemorrhagies , or Bleedings at the Nose and Fundament , and also so great a Weakness in their Knees , that they could not go without reeling or staggering .

There came in the Cheeks of several a small White Ulcer , which was hard all round ; unless we took care to stop it presently , and to take it off with the Spirit of Vitriol , it grew presently livid or blue , black and stinking , and eat up part of the Cheek , so that one might see the Teeth thro ' it .

Now it happened , that about the latter end of March and April last we had much and violent Thunder and Lightning , which had this unhappy effect upon all the parcels of Wheat and Rye of the last years growth , that , though over - night they were dry , sweet , and fit for shipping , the next morning they had lost all these good qualities , and were become clammy and stinking , and consequently unfit to be ship ' t away for the present : So that the Owners , if they would not loose their grain , were forced to cause it to be turned over two or three times a day , and yet it required six weeks , if not longer , before it was recovered .	This is a thing , which often happens to Corn that hath not lain in the Granary a whole year , or not sweat thoroughly in the straw before it be thrashed out .

ro7452	odour		pungent								It will not be found economical to saturate the zincethyl at one operation , on account of the caking of the materials , which renders the fracture of the retort very probable ; independently of which , the strong heat then necessary partly decomposes the radical when formed .	The distillate last obtained should , however , always contain a slight excess of zincethyl ; otherwise there is no certainty of removing traces of an iodide , the nature of which will be presently noticed , and which imparts a pungent odour to the radical .	By agitation with dilute acid and water , two strata of liquids are produced , the lower of which was fractioned with the thermometer .
ro7452	odour		exceedingly pungent|irritating								Cold concentrated acids do not immediately attack stannic diethyl ; but when heated , they disengage gases and form salts , which differ in constitution according to the prolongation of the action .	Hydrochloric acid converts the substance into an uncrystallizable chloride , insoluble in water , and - possessed of an exceedingly pungent and irritating odour .	It is only after long digestion that a crystalline body is formed .
ro7452	odour								when exposed to the air		An experiment was conducted under water , the bromine being added to the stannic diethyl in such quantity that a slight but permanent red tint showed that it was in excess .	An oily liquid was obtained which possessed the characteristic odour , but which , when exposed to the air , shot into a mass of crystals .	These were pressed in paper , and placed for some hours under the air - pump before they were analysed .

The salts of stanethyl have been , at different times , stated by FRANEIAND and LoWG as odorous and inodorous .	Further experiment , therefore , appeared desirable before definitively fixing the formula .
ro7452	odorous|odorous	substance	odorous|odorous								By gentle evaporation , fine hard and almost inodorous crystals were obtained , which differed from the bromide in being easily and entirely soluble in water .	The irritating odorous substance was by this treatment entirely transferred to the alkaline solution .	This chloride was dried over sulphuric acid and analysed .
ro7452	odour	an oily body|which	pungent|irritating								Bichloride of tin produces great heat when dropped into zincethyl .	If the tin - salt be in excess , an impure chloride of stanethyl is formed ; if the zincethyl be in excess , the radical stannic diethyl is formed ; whilst , lastly , if the zincethyl be present in quantity insufficient for the last reaction , that is , less than sufficient to remove the whole of the chlorine , the chief product is an oily body , which possesses the pungent and irritating odour before alluded to .	This pungency , which produces continued sneezing , entirely disappears on adding zincethyl to saturation .
ro7452	odour	of the oily chloride	characteristic								The aqueous solution was then poured off , and solution of potash added , when an abundant precipitate of oxide of stanethyl showed that no double salt had been effected with the chloride of stanethyl .	The portion insoluble in water proved to be the unchanged radical , and did not exhibit the characteristic odour of the oily chloride , which thus could have been readily detected .	This negative answer to the first equation showed that the substance was no simple mixture , but a definite compound .

The solution , on the other hand , with hydrochloric acid liberated the above - mentioned odorous oil .	To isolate this last , the whole was mixed in a mortar with rather strong aqueous potash , and the magma washed in a funnel plugged with asbestos .

If this impure iodide be treated with aqueous potash , it will be remarked that a comparatively small quantity of oxide of stanethyl falls .

ro7456	smell	of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid							A few drops of sulphuric acid|Very strong acetic acid		As many properties of the entire liquor , before it had been evaporated to dryness , had led me to imagine that the acid was united with the alkali , and remained in combination with it , in the state of oxygenized muriatic acid , till the moment of crystallization , I think it necessary to state at length the appearances which induced me to draw that conclusion , and the experiments which afterwards convinced me that it was erroneous .	A few drops of sulphuric acid , poured into some of the entire liquor , caused an effervescence , and a smell of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid , Very strong acetic acid produced the same effect .	By other experiments , I had ascertained that acetic acid could not decompose any part of the entire salt ; and hence I concluded , that in the entire liquor , before evaporation , some of the salt remained in the state of oxygenized muriate , the acid of which was expelled by the sulphuric or acetic acid ; and , that it was not till the moment of crystallization , that the elements of the salt underwent a total resolution into muriate , and hyperoxygenized muriate , of potash .
ro7456	smell				oxygenized muriatic acid gas					promotes an uncommon and rather painful secretion of tears	The acid is expelled , with particular phenomena , by sulphuric , nitric , and Inuriatic acids , without heat ; and , a little below a boiling heat , by phosphoric , oxalic , tartareous , citric , and arsenic acids : but they are not acted upon by benzoic , acetic , acetous , boracic , prussic , or carbonic acids .	Those vegetable acids which are powerful enctLgh to decompose them , give out , towards the end , a gas of a peculiar nature , which has not so much smell as oxygenized muriatic acid gas , but which affects the eyes in an extraordinary manner , and promotes an uncommon and rather painful secretion of tears .	I have not yet examined this gas , as there was invariably an inflammation of the mixture , with explosion and rupture of the vessels , almost as soon as it began to be evolved .

The smell is not altogether TS unlike nitrous gas ; but is peculiarly fetid , and may be compared to that which is emitted by brick - kilns , mixed with that of nitrous gas .	It differs much from oxygenized muriatic acid gas the latter being pungent and penetrating , the other heavy and oppressive ; and it does not produce , at least in so great a degree , the catarrhal symptoms caused by the other .

At the bottom of this vapour is a bright orange - coloured liquor , which has the same smell as the vapour .	This is the acid contained in the salt ; and I have proved it to be hyperoxygenized muriatic acid .
ro7456	smell		rather less distinct and marked						Nitric acid		But , though I really believe this to have been the case , I do not positively affirm it .	Nitric acid produces nearly the same phenomena ; but the smell and other properties are rather less distinct and marked , than with sulphuric acid .	Muriatic acid decomposes this salt , and unites to its basis ; but neither the yellow vapours , nor the orange - coloured liquor , are produced .

It is decomposed at a very low temperature , and gives out a quantity of gas , together with a smell of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid .	Such a smell is doubtless owing to the great quantity of oxygen contained in the acid ; it being more than is necessary to combine with the quantity of hydrogen contained in the alkali , and therefore some of the acid is disengaged , without decomposition .

The alumina shortly disappeared ; and , upon pouring sulphuric acid into the liquor , a strong smell of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid was perceivable .	When I ' attempted to obtain the salt pure , by phosphate of silver , in the usual way , I found nothing in solution but hyperoxygenized muriate of silver ; * and all the hyperoxygenized muriate of alumina had been decomposed .

This is a sufficient proof , that corrosive sublimate is not a hyperoxygenized muriate of mercury .

As soon as muriatic acid is poured on the powder of the magnetical pyrites , a slight - effervescence is produced , which becomes violently increased by the application of heat ; a quantity of gas is discharged , which by its odour , by its inflammability , by the colour of the flame , by the deposition of sulphur - when burned , and by other properties , was proved to be sulphuretted hydrogen .

When rubbed between the fingers , a faint peculiar smell may be observed , unlike that produced by any other metal under the same circumstances .	If a perfectly bright surface of thallium is applied to the tongue , no taste whatever is observed ; but a tarnished surface tastes strongly alkaline , and somewhat sweet like oxide of lead ; whilst if the surface is more oxidized than usual , from the metal having been long exposed to the air , or previously raised to a high temperature , the taste is very caustic and biting , remaining on the tongue for some hours , and resembling that observed when the tongue is applied to the terminals of a voltaic pile .

Potassium strongly heated in it in a small glass tube over mercury , burnt with a dull red light , and formed an alkaline product of the same intense black colour as that produced by its combustion in the carbonic acid procured by the dissolution of marble : distilled water absorbed rather less than its own volume of the gas , and became subacid , sparkled by agitation , gained the taste and smell of a solution of carbonic acid in water , precipitated in the same manner lime water , and when in excess redissolved the precipitate .	To ascertain if this precipitate was exactly the same in composition as pure carbonate of lime , I made a sufficient quantity of it by pouring lime water into the recipient containing the results of the first experiment ; and after collecting and drying it at the temperature of ig2 ? FAHRENHEIT , I introduced a quantity of it contained in some foil of platinum through mercury into a glass tube filled with mercury , and I heated in the same manner an equal quantity of finely powdered Carrara marble , and admitted to them equal quantities of solution of muriatic acid .

The Discerning and Candid Reader will find in the perusal of theBook it self abundance of Instruction in that matter ; besides the explication of a great variety of phenomenon , occurring in the contemplation of Vegetables ; as , Why the Organical Parts are void ofTast , Smell and Colour .	Whence the Succiferous Vessels are tough , and the Parenchymous parts friable ? How the said succiferous Vessels grow in length , cylindrical , and hollow ; the Lactiferous , how and why wider ? How the Air - vessels are formed ? How the Parenchymous parts become fibrous , and the Fibres disposed into Bubles ? How all stitched up together ? Whence the situation of the Air - and Succiferous vessels ; whence the Motion of the Air - vessels towards the circumference of the Root ; and whence many of the succiferous left behind the Air - vessels in the Pith ?

When any Part of it is enclosed and kept from the Communication of the outward Air , it expands itself , and , in Proportion to the Closeness of the Place , loses its Spring ; and if any Heat or Moisture comes to it , the elastic Force may be quite lost and destroyed : And not only so , but if it happens to be impregnated with noxious Effluvia , either from unwholesome Substances of any kind , or from the infectious Breath of diseased Bodies ; it will become quite poisonous and deadly , in a manner suitable to the original Cause .	Of the gases above - mentioned , however , the specific gravity , combustibility , and intensity of light during combustion , are often much interfered with by the presence of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid .

Upon the whole , tho ' there were some Marks of a latent Alcali in the putrid Serum , they were so very faint , that one Drop of Spirit of Hartshorn in a Quantity of Water equal to that of the putrid Liquors , showed more of an Alcali than twenty Drops of any of the other .	2 .

Boyle found that this held good only in Urine ; and that in the Distillation of the Serum of human Blood putrefied , the Liquor which first came over had little Strength , either as to its Smell or Taste , and did not at first effervesce with an Acid .	And here it may be observed , that the Chemists have generally applied those Properties they discovered in Urine , to all the Humours indifferently ; whereas , in Fact , there is a great Diversity .

May not the cause of these latebrae being left unfinished arise from their meeting in those places with strata too hard , harsh , and solid for their purpose , which they relinquish , and go to a fresh spot that works more freely ? Or may they not in other places fall in with a soil as much too loose and mouldering , liable to flounder , and threatening to overwhelm them and their labours ? One thing is remarkable , that after some years the old holes are forsaken , and new ones bored ; perhaps because the old habitations grow foul and fetid from long use ; or because they may so abound with fleas as to become untenantable .	This species of swallow , moreover , is strangely annoyed with fleas ; and we have seen fleas , bed - fleas ( pulex irritans ) swarming at the mouths of these holes like bees on the stools of their hives .

I am therefore humbly of Opinion , that the Stamina , or Principles of this wonderful Copulation , or mixing of Colours , are carried thro ' the Air by the Wind ; and that the Time , or Season of it , is , when the Corn is in the Earing , and while the Milk is in the Grain , for at that Time , the Corn is in a Sort of Estuation , and emits a strong Scent .

The earth shook at the same time , that a volley of pumice stones fell thick upon us ; in an instant , clouds of black smoke and ashes caused almost a total darkness ; the explosions sions from the top of the mountain were much louder than any thunder I ever heard , and the smell of the sulphur was very offensive .

ro7742	odoriferous|odoriferous	flowers	very odoriferous|odoriferous								I took ( saith he ) a quantity of Orange - flowers , and put them into half a pound of Oil of sweet Almonds , together with a little Rock - allom , and so incIosed all in a glassflask ; which being well stopped , I exposed to the Sun for a Month , adding still more flowers , when I found the first were putrified , yet without taking these out .	A Month being passed , I powered out the OyI , impregnated with the virtue of those flowers and very odoriferous , into several Glass ~ Vials , and carefully set them aside , leaving them untouched till the next Spring ; at which time looking upon these Vials , I observed within them certain Flowers swimming in the Oil , which to me appeared not at all different from true and fresh Leaves and Flowers of the Orange - Tree .	But the wonder increased some Months after , when the hot season being advanced , the Flowers were turned into Fruit about the same time that such fruit was ripened upon the Tree ; there being seen at the bottom of the Vials some small Oranges with their proper colour , together with those small specks , which that fruit uses to have ; so that they were in nothing distinguishable from true Oranges , their smallness excepted .
ro7743	odour				resembling that of certain bases of the pyridine series						For example , perfectly pure barium hydrate in solution does not dissolve turacin ; but let a minute trace of soda exist , as it often does , in the baryta - solution , and then the liquid will become readily tinted if shaken up with a fragment of turacin .	Very strong solutions of the caustic alkalies dissolve the pigment , but at the same time it suffers a partial decomposition , evidenced by an odour resembling that of certain bases of the pyridine series , which it then evolves .	Fuming nitric acid dissolves it with a deep brown tint , destroying it ; in oil of vitriol it is soluble , but in all probability with partial alteration .
ro7746	smell	her skin	urinous								From the 26th of April , 1756 , she made no water , and felt no want of making it , for many months ; yet all this time she could eat once or twice a day , and was able to walk and ride .	She was sparing in the use of liquids ; she had but little sleep , no sweats , and her skin had no urinous smell : her breathing was often very laborious , with a dry cough : the catamenia were irregular : there were oedematous swellings in her limbs , abdomen , hips , and face ; but , by the help of purges , and spontaneous vomitings , which began in the third month of the suppression , these swellings were tolerably kept under .	She vomited sometimes every day , and sometimes only every third or fourth day ; and tho ' these vomitings usually came on presently after dinner , yet what she vomited seemed to be mere urine , without any thing which she had eaten mixed with it .
ro7746	scent		urinous								She vomited sometimes every day , and sometimes only every third or fourth day ; and tho ' these vomitings usually came on presently after dinner , yet what she vomited seemed to be mere urine , without any thing which she had eaten mixed with it .	In the beginning of June 1757 , the nipples of her breasts chopped , and discharged sometimes a watery humour , sometimes a thick matter , streaked with blood , and sometimes a humour approaching to the colour of urine : all these discharges had an urinous scent , and seemed to lessen her urinous vomitings , which , from this time , became less frequent : but her legs , and especially her body , swelled to an extraordinary size , and she breathed with the utmost difficulty .	On the first and second of August , 1757 , after a total suppression of urine for above a year and three months , she felt uncommon pricking pains , with great heat all down her back and loins , and about the belly and groin .

When the flame is urged by the blowpipe , the laminne separate still more , and are changed into an extremely light and brittle enamel , pure white , and having a pearly lustre .
ro7766	smell	it									] In the course of the author ' s inquiries respecting the digestive organs of different animals , he has been gradually led to suppose that the office of the colon and lower intestines in general is different from that of the upper .	In the stomach and small intestines the process of forming and separating the chyle is carried on ; but after the food has passed into the cwecum and colon , it appears to undergo a total change in its appearance and smell , with some tendency to putrefaction , that is not observable in the contents of the small intestines , and is prevented from being communicated to them by a valve that does not allow even gases to pass upwards into the small intestines .	The general construction also of the colon and cweca favours the opinion that the functions which they perform are of a different kind ; since their capacity and arrangement would occasion the passage of their contents to be more tardy than it is through the small intestines .
ro7766	smell	animal substances							semi|putrescent|buried in the ground in moist situations		The general construction also of the colon and cweca favours the opinion that the functions which they perform are of a different kind ; since their capacity and arrangement would occasion the passage of their contents to be more tardy than it is through the small intestines .	The smell and semi - putrescent state of these matters led to a comparison of them with animal substances buried in the ground in moist situations , which are known to be converted into adipocere , , and suggested the possibility that the secondary digestive operation performed in the lower intestines might be the formation of fat ; and this conjecture appeared to the author to be supported by the consideration , that fat is the winter supply in dormant animals , and that these animals have a formation of intestines peculiar to themselves , in which there is no valve to distinguish the beginning of the colon , and no other impediment to the free supply of materials for the production of fat .	The author next adduces an instance of the conversion of a corpse into adipocere ( in the course of twenty - one years ) in Shoreditch churchyard ; and compares the situation of feculent matters retained in the cells of the colon with a current of more fluid matters passing over them with that of bodies buried in the neighbourhood of a common sewer ; and he enumerates various instances in which substances of a fatty nature are known to be formed in the large intestines .

Human muscle when digested with water alone , at the temperature of 100 ? , for four days , became slightly putrid without any appearance of fat ; but when digested with human bile at the same temperature it became fetid on the second day , fetid and yellow on the third , and on the fourth it had the smell of excrement , was flabby , and appeared fatty on the surface .	A second experiment on beef in the bile of the ox had the same result as the preceding .

First therefore I cleaved asunder the Breast - bone from the Gartilage , called Ensi - formis , to the Neck ; when , laying open the hollow of the Thorax , there steam ' d out at first a very offensive smell , notwithstanding the sharp frost there was at that time , it being about Christmas .	Then making way to lay open either side of the Sternum , I was surprised to see ( as I thought ) almost the whole Cavity of the Thorax empty above , ( as the Body lay supine ) and filled with nothing but thick Milk beneath .
ro7806	fetid|fetid		very fetid|fetid								Observation the 3d , is upon a cancerous tumor of the same nature , and in the same situation , and the treatment just the same : it was as big as a filbert , and the officer was afflicted with it twenty years .	It differs from the former only in this , that the year before the officer came to Marseilles , to put himself under Monsieur Daviel ' s cure , the tumor broke , and discharged a very fetid acrimonious matter , which , running into the eye , brought on a troublesome opthalmia , and the edges were livid , and had a very terrible aspect .	As to his operation , it consisted , as before , of a total extirpation of the cancer , periosteum and all , to the bare bone .
ro7813	olfactory|olfactory	apparatus	olfactory|olfactory								25 ) .	The olfactory apparatus and lateral masses of the ethmoid are entirely absent ; but the posterior parts of the alae of the vomer are enormously expanded to take their place , and pass up on each side of the central plate of the ethmoid in front of the frontals , even as far as the nasals , forming the whole posterior wall of the nares , viz .	the whole of that wall which in other Mammals is formed by the ethmoid .
ro7813	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								In that case we must differ from Professor who considers that the central plate of the ethmoid represents in a coalesced condition the prefrontals of the fish or reptile * , and plays the part which we allot to the lateral masses in the neural arch of the vomerine segment .	It cannot do so , for these reasons : 1st , that while the lateral masses of the ethmoid are continuous with the vomer , the central plate is never truly continuous , but only contiguous to the vomer ; 2ndly , that the central plate must , for reasons above stated , play the part of a centrum ; and 3rdly , that , as Professor GOODSIR has shown , Professor OWEN ' S view is inconsistent with the relation of the olfactory nerves to the central plate t .	3 .
ro7813	smell	the ethmovomerine segment									In front of the parietal segment lies the presphenoid , connected with which are the organs of vision .	In front of the frontal segment lies the ethmovomerine segment , and connected with it are the organs of smell .	None of the three ' segments connected with the special senses has a complete neural arch .
ro7813	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								Still , however , the morphological interpretation of the amaalian nostrils is that they are intersegmental clefts .	They are similar clefts to those in which the eye and ear are developed ; and the alar cartilages pass round the olfactory clefts exactly as the tarsal cartilages pass round the optic clefts , and the pinna of the ear and the tympanic bone round the auditory clefts .	Thus these structures are morphologically as well as functionally comparable ; they encircle openings which pass from the dermal to the mucous surface , and which primarily lie in the transverse plane ; although in Mammalia the malar , which belongs to the facial segmentt , passes backwards and sends up a process behind the orbit , and , in a similar manner , the intermaxillary and maxillary send up processes behind the nostril .
ro7813	olfactory|olfactory	sense	olfactory|olfactory								In other animals the arrangement is perhaps not so distinct , and there may be a difficulty , especially in mammals , to determine if the nasals do not , in part , at least , form a continuation of the roof of the cranial cavity ; for in them the neural arch of the ethmoidal sclerotome is , as we have seen , a continuation of that cavity , and is open in front .	But , inasmuch as in the mammal the olfactory - sense capsules are withdrawn into the interior of the ethmoidal neural arch , the cranial cavity is closed in by soft parts at a point posterior to the nasals ; and I therefore incline to think that the nasals , protecting in this , as in other cases , the nostrils , are , like those of the Frog , similar in nature to the orbital processes of the cetacean frontals .	NOTE .
ro7814	smell	osmium	peculiar								The residuum of the rhodium alloy obtained by boiling in diluted sulphuric acid , had the combustible matter burnt off , and the powder digested in hot muriatic acid : this removed the iron ; and by long digestion in nitro - muriatic acid , a muriate of rhodium was formed , distinguishable by its colour , and by the triple salt it formed with muriate of soda .	To analyse the compound of steel with iridium and osmium , the alloy should be acted on by dilute sulphuric acid , and the residuum boiled in the acid ; the powder left is to be collected and heated with caustic soda in a silver crucible to dull redness for a quarter of an hour , the whole to be mixed with water , and having had excess of sulphuric acid added , it is to be distilled , and that which passes over condensed in a flask : it will be a solution of oxide of osmium , will have the peculiar smell belonging to that substance , and will give a blue precipitate with tincture of galls .	The portion in the retort being then poured out , the insoluble part is to be washed in repeated portions of water , and then being first slightly acted on by muriatic acid to remove the iron , is to be treated with nitro - muriatic acid , which will give a muriate of iridium .
ro7822	smell		heavy|little								It is of a blackish red , foul colour , solid and heavy , losing little of its weight by being long kept ; and it is not easily distinguished from that of Arabia Felix .	The third and worst kind is gathered from old wounds or gashes , formerly made , in old trees ; or myrrh that , passing unnoticed , has hung upon the tree ungathered a whole year ; black and earth - like in colour , and heavy , with little smell and bitterness .	This apparently is the caucalis of the ancients .
ro7822	smell	it	very strong|rancid|oily						when we buy fresh or new myrrh|when thrown into water		But as SERAPION and the Arabs say , that stacte was a preparation of myrrh dissolved in water , it is probable , that this unknown green kind of DIOSCORIDES was , like the stacte , a composition of myrrh and some other ingredient , not a species of Abyssinian myrrh , which he could never have seen , either soft or green .	It may be remarked , that when we buy fresh or new myrrh , it has always a very strong , rancid , oily smell ; and when thrown into water , globules of an oily matter swim upon the surface .	This greasiness is not from the myrrh ; it is owing to the savages using goats - skins anointed with butter ( to make them supple ) wherein to put their myrrh at gathering ; and in these skins it remains , and is brought to market : so that , far from its being a fault , as some ignorant druggists at Rome and Venice believe , it is a mark that the myrrh is fresh gathered , which is the best quality that myrrh of the first sort can have .

Secondly , gives some Chemical Analysis of Niter , both by calcination , in which he saith that it burns almost all away if refined ; and by Destillation in a Retort , which makes it yield a little Flegme , then a Spirit , first in the form of a white , and soon after in that of a red vapour , corrosive and fetid , leaving a Caput mortuum behind .

ro7861	Scent		valuable								But Truth is the Daughter of Time ; it is now at Length found out , that this Occultum Naturae is an Animal Production , and bred in the Body of the Sperma Ceti Whale , analogous to what is found in some Animals of the Land , as the Musk Hog or Taiacu , the Musk Deer , the Bezoar Sheep , and some Amphibious Animals , as the Musquash , & amp ; c .	who have their valuable Scent in a particular Cystis or Bag .	I am apt to think , that which first gave Occasion to the Notion of Ambergris being the Production of the Whale , was because it was found in considerable Quantities on the Shores of the Summer Islands , and among the Bahama ' s , where the dead Whales are frequently wrecked and broke up with the Sea , and the Ambergris found floating , or on the Shore ; but here again , the Ingenious , until very lately , were at a Loss , and divided in Opinion , for tho ' they agreed it to come from the Whale , yet some took it to be the true and proper Semen , being found only in the Bull , at the Root of the Penis , near the Testicles ; others again thought it was the Ordure or Excrement of the Whale .
ro7861	smelling|Scent	with the Balls of Ambergris	strong|rather stronger	This Bag							His Relation , which was taken a few Days since from his own Mouth , is as follows : The Ambergris is found only in the Sperma Ceti Whales , and consists of Balls or globular Bodies , of various Sizes , from about three Inches to twelve Inches Diameter , and will weigh from a Pound and an Half to twenty two Pounds , lying loose in a large oval Bag or Bladder of three or four Foot long , and two or three Foot deep and wide , almost in the Form of an Ox ' s Bladder , only the Ends more acute , or like a Blacksmith ' s long Bellows , with a Spout running tapering into and thro ' the Length of the Penis , and a Duct , or Canal , opening into the other End of the Bag , and coming from towards the Kidneys ; this Bag lies just over the Testicles , which are above a Foot long , and is placed lengthways at the Root of the Penis , about four or five Foot below the Navel , and three or four above the Anus .	This Bag or Bladder is almost full of a deep Orange coloured Liquor , not quite so thick as Oil , and smelling strong , or rather stronger of the same Scent with the Balls of Ambergris , which float and swim loose in it ; the Inside of the Bag is very deeply tinged with the same Colour as the Liquor , which may also be found in the Canal of the Penis ; the Balls seem to be pretty hard while the Whale is alive , inasmuch as there are many Times found , upon opening the Bag , large concave Shelves , of the same Substance and Consistence , that have scaled off from them , and the Balls themselves seem to be composed of several distinct Coats enclosing one another , something like the Coats of an Onion .	As to the Number of Balls , Mr .

As for my own Part , I dare not pretend to give any Opinion upon the Point , but content myself with relating Matter of Fact .
ro7862	Smell	it	strong		like Brimstone				Upon firing this sulphurous Bitumen on a red - hot Iron		Here they met with Stones of a very close Texture , which when washed seemed to be nothing but a Mass of Shells jumbled and embodyed together .	And a little lower the Clay produced some Lumps of a black , bituminous Sulphur , interlaid with some small thin Laminae , seeming to be metalline and bright like the purest Silver : Upon firing this sulphurous Bitumen on a red - hot Iron , it emitted a blue Flame , and strong Smell like Brimstone , but the Metal was lost .	From this Account of the different Strata found in sinking these Wells , their Impregnation seems to be from Alum , Vitriol of Steel , Ochre and Sulphur , and from an accurate Mixture of all these , which no Art can imitate , it seems to derive those admirable Qualities with which it is endued .

At common temperatures it appears as a colourless transparent liquid , of specific gravity 0 * 85 , at 60 ? ; having the general odour of oil - gas .	Below 42 ? it is a solid body , forming dendritical transparent crystals , and contracting much during its congelation .
ro7873	Smelling|Odours|odoriferous|odoriferous|Smells|Smelling	Particles	odoriferous|odoriferous	in			the Human Body			causing Tears to flow	His Reason is , not that the Organs differ at any time from what they always were , but because the Soul sometimes changes her Ideas , even from the same Impressions , and that therefore there can be no Ideas essential to any Impressions ; or at least , that there are none which the Soul cannot change : He also says , that Imagination is much concerned in the Variation of Tastes .	The Sense of Smelling is discussed in his Third Chapter , wherein he observes the same Method as in the Two former , in describing the Mechanism of the Organs serving to that Sense , and accounting for the Conveyance of Odours to those Organs ; and for the Stimulus of some odoriferous Particles causing Tears to flow , as well as Sneezing caused by a glaring Light ; and , after making some Reflections on the many Effects of Smells upon the Human Body , and the exquisite Sense of Smelling in some Animals , he recites the Story told by Sir K .

He also mentions the Perfection of Smelling in the Inhabitants of the Antibes , who can run a Man upon the Nose like an Hound ; and concludes this Section with a Relation of a Friar of Prague , from the Journals des Scavans , who could not only distinguish different Persons from each other by Smelling , but also an incontinent Woman from a chaste one ; and adds , in a joking Strain , that this Man had begun a Trearise of Odours before he died , which the Journalists much regretted the Loss of : But , says Monsieur le Cat , for my part , I do not know but a Person so exquisite in this kind of Knowledge would be dangerous in Society .	He proceeds next to treat of Hearing , and brings under that Head the whole Mechanism and Doctrine of Sounds ; the Vibrations of all sounding Bodies : And from the Experiment of holding a Candle near any vibrating or sounding Body , without the Flame ' s being moved or otherways affected , he argues , that the common Air docs not produce the Sound , but a more subtle Fluid better proportioned to the Organs of hearing : Here he runs into a Detail of the Principles of the Chords and Tones of Music , and makes a new and curious Comparison between the principal Colours in the Rays of Light , and the foresaid Fluid , which is more or less subtle in the Air , some Particles of which are only capable of being moved to express low Tones , other higher , and so on successively , as far as the Compass of Music reaches ; just as the Light is composed of certain kinds of Rays , some of which produce Red , some Green , & amp ; c .

ro7877	Smell		strong sulphureous								Out of all these Openings sprung forth a great Quantity of Water , which drowned the neighbouring Places .	This Water was in some Places hot , with a strong sulphureous Smell , which lasted , even after the Earthquakes were over , and induced some of the Inhabitants , not without Success , to make use of it in curing of Ulcers , and other cutaneous Diseases , for which chiefly a hot Well near Lazaretto became very famous .	Out of some of these Gapings of the Earth issued a thick Stench and Smoke , very troublesome to all the Neighbourhood .
ro7877	noxious|Effluvia	mineral									I proceed now , with all possible Brevity , to run over the several Observations , which our Author makes about the Causes and Effects of Earthquakes in general : He observes , That such Countries as abound much with Fossilcoals , as England , some Parts of Germany , and even Sicily itself , are more subject to Tremblings of the Earth , than any other .	That pestilential and other Diseases , which frequently follow great Earthquakes , are rather to be ascribed to noxious and infected mineral Effluvia , which upon such an Occasion issue out of the Earth through the several Openings , than to the Putrefaction of dead Bodies , which perished in the Earthquake , and were buried under the Ruins of destroyed Buildings .	That amongst the Minerals hidden in the Entrails of the Earth some are combustible , some not ; that of the combustible Ones , as Sulphur , Bitumen , Alum , Vitriol , Salt - Petre , & amp ; c .

That Baccius , Kircher , and others , which draw the Origin of the abovementioned sulphureous Lake near Mena , and of several others in other Places from the subterraneous Cavities of the Mountain AEtna , are much in the wrong , there being not the least Necessity of its being derived so far , since the Country every where abounds with combustible Minerals , which rather seem to entertain and nourish the fiery Eruptions of AEtna , than to be occasioned by them .

The precipitate consisted of muriate and phosphate of silver and lead , in combination with a little animal matter , the odour of which was perceptible on exposing it to heat after it had been washed and dried .	One thousand grains of saliva , afforded by careful evaporation in a water bath , resicdlm : weighing one hundred and eighty grains , from which twenty grains of saline matter , consisting of phosphate of lime and muriate of soda , were obtained by incineration .

Both glass and amber I have also made electrical by blowing upon them ( previously warmed ) with a pair of bellows .

Within the fistula are fix blind holes having no out - let ; four tending toward the snout ; two above the valve that stops the nostrils ; and two beneath it ; two tending towards the brain , having a long but narrow cavity for the use of smelling , as I conjecture , though opening the brain I could find neither olfactory nerves nor processus mammillares .

A portion of the sycoretin , prepared as stated above by fractional precipitation , was added to concentrated sulphuric acid ; it was readily dissolved , forming a fine deep red solution , which gave off only a faint odour of sulphurous acid when kept for several days .	By exposure to the air , or on addition of water , a brownish precipitate deposited , which differed from the original solution by its lesser solubility ; the aqueous liquid contained a trace of a sulpho - copulate acid , but no saccharine substance could be discovered .

The existence of a volatile acid with the odour of acetic acid , was rendered evident by saturating the alkaline mother - liquor with phosphoric acid and distilling ; the distillate was saturated with carbonate of barium and evaporated to the crystallization point , when prism4ic crystals , of the characteristic form of acetate of barium , were obtained .

This large nerve has been called by several authors the olfactory nerve of fishes ; but I think it might with more truth and propriety be considered as a collection of the nerves , which supply the organs of tasting , smelling , and hearing , confined in a sheath , which is a production of the integuments of the brain .	From the whole I would conclude , that fishes do hear ; and that therefore gunpowder is unfit for projecting harpoons .
ro7920	odour	of guano|its	peculiar								The result of a comparative trial made with the urine of the whiteheaded Sea - Eagle , in one instance kept in darkness , in the other exposed to bright sunshine for many successive days , afforded an answer in the affirmative .	Whilst the urine of the Sea - Eagle , consisting chiefly of lithate of ammonia , kept in the dark , underwent no change , that exposed to light was materially changed , most of the lithate of ammonia had disappeared , its place was supplied by oxalate of ammonia , the peculiar odour of guano was acquired , and in part its brownish hue .	From considering the composition of the lithic and oxalic acids , the author infers , that in the conversion of the one into the other , oxygen is absorbed ; and , in confirmation , he mentions that although no change takes place when moist lithate of ammonia is exposed alone to a temperature of about 212 ? , it is otherwise if so treated when mixed with black oxide of manganese , in which case oxalate of ammonia is formed , and also some brown colouring matter , not unlike that of guano ; and this colouring matter , he supposes , may appropriate to itself the excess of carbon and hydrogen , that is , such proportions of these substances in the lithic acid as are more than those required to form oxalic acid and ammonia .

The complete obscurity 2e was only occasionally broken by the lightning , which flashed in every direction , while the air was rent with loud and reiterated explosions like the discharges of artillery , which accompanied each eruption of volcanic matter , and conspired to strike the deepest terror , and to spread among the inhabitants a universal panic that the day of judge ? meant was arrived .

The compact portions of this oolite partake of the property common to compact limestones of all ages and formations , of being perforated by irregular holes and caverns intersecting them in all directions ; the cause of these cavities has never been satisfactorily ascertained : into this question ( which is one of considerable difficulty in geology ) it is foreign to my present purpose to enquire , any farther than to state that they were neither produced , enlarged , or diminished by the presence of the animals whose bones we now find in them .

ro8016	odour	pyrites|sulphate|alum|by most of the mineral coals	sulphureous						when burned		Our author indeed admits that bitumen has never been formed by any artificial process , and that he has himself attempted it , in various ways , without success : yet we may conclude , from what has been already said , that bitumen is a modification of the resinous and oily parts of vegetables , produced by some process of nature , operated by gradual means on immense masses ; and we have , he thinks , great reason to conclude that the agent employed by nature in the formation of coal and bitumen is either the muriatic or the sulphuric acid .	Common salt , however , is never found in coal - mines , except when they are in the vicinity of salt - springs ; whilst , on the contrary , pyrites , sulphate of iron , and alum , are commonly found in such mines ; from which circumstances , together with the sulphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral coals when burned , the agency of sulphuric acid is strongly evinced ; and , as we have already observed , the coals formed artificially from vegetable substances , by means of sulphuric acid , bear a strong resemblance to the mineral coals , not only in their external characters , but also in their other properties .

Why Sweet smells raise Hysterique passions ; and saetid ones , remedy the same ? 2 .	Why there is so special a consent of the Womb with the Breasts ? Concerning both which we refer the Reader to the Author himself , and proceed to the Third Dissertation , in which he inquires , Whence it is , that Milk is the best Aliment of the Body ? And to satisfy this Inquiry ; he presupposes , that the proxime nourishment is to be as like as may be to the Body to be nourish ' t , and that we subsist by the same things , of which we are generated , and that the Faetus is fed in the womb , not with Blood , but a Milky Juice , taken in at the Mouth , and severed from the Blood in the Uterus by the Placenta , as a Strainer ; as it is in the Breasts by the Glanduls and Tubes designed for the same purpose .

In the same Letter he affirms , that in the Brain there is made a certain very subtle and well - scented liquor , which he believes to be the Seat of the Reasonable Soul ; and that the Wit of men depends on the Temper of this Liquor , rather than from the Conformation of the Brain : Which he confirms by the Example of one , who by taking great store of Tobacco , had so dried up his Brain , that after his death there was found in his Head but a very small black clod , composed of sundry membrans ; and yet his Soul had not been wanting to perform her functions to the last .	He also takes occasion to discourse of Respiration , adventuring to affirm , that Respiration is caused by divers liquors , which rising through the Veins into the Heart , and there fermenting , send to the Lungs such Vapors as attract the Air : For illustration whereof , he saith , That , if to a Glass - bowl , hollow and with a small hole , you sodder divers Pipes of Glass half full of different strong Liquors , the Vapours , elevated from those Pipes in the glass - bowl , will draw the Air after the same manner as tis drawn into the Lungs by Respiration .

When sulphur was introduced into it , there was at first no action , but an explosion soon took place : and the peculiar smell of oxymuriate of sulphur was perceived , Phosphorus produced a brilliant explosion , by contact with it in the cold , and there was produced phosphoric acid and solid oxymuriate of phosphorus .	Arsenic introduced into it did not inflame ; the gas was made to explode , when the metal burnt with great brilliancy in the oxymuriatic gas .

To all which he adds the several sorts , Praeparations , and Receipts of Opiats : Where he takes occasion to discourse of the nature of Opium it self , and of the parts wherein the Narcotick force consists ; showing withal by Experiments , that it works not equally in all Animals , and particularly not in Doggs , as it doth in Cats and Men ; teaching also the preparation of Opium , and reckoning up the Opiats both of the Ancients and Moderns ; and further instructing his Reader , that the best Menstruum for making liquid Laudanum ' s , is Spirit of Wine impregnated with the volatilized salt of Tartar ; this having a peculiar virtue of speedy dissolving the mass of Opium , of taking a Ruby - like tincture , and of somewhat subduing its Narcotick sulphur , and taking away its strong smell .	He concludes the whole with his description and opinion of Helmonts Laudanum ; and with his thoughts of Tobacco and Coffee .

That it is of a Citron colour , remaining such as tis made , of a moderate both thickness and copiousness , having also a competent sediment , and a due ( somewhat strong ) smell : Though as to the sediment he notes , that in hot Countries , where a great evacuation is made by the pores of the Body , that is found not so considerable , in healthy persons , as in cold and moist Climats .	As for those , that allege the death of some Patients with healthy water , even in time , free from the Plague and malignant Fevers , he is persuaded , that they are either unskilful in Urines , or prejudiced concerning them , since it seems to him not more possible , that a man should dye with a healthy urine , than with a sound body and blood ; forasmuch as the urine is mixed with the blood and Spirits through the whole body .

Touching the Copiousness , he observes , what quantity of Urine is generally made by sound people ? What the cause is of much urine , and what the sign thereof ; as also what may be collected from Urine made in a smaller quantity than ordinarily ? As to the Qualities ; and first the Smell of Urine , be teaches , what may be inferred from thence ? That divers causes may render it fetid ; that some things taken inwardly retain their smell in the Urine , as Turpentine ; that some things bred in the body make the water stinking , or at least of a very strong smell , as Ulcers , and purulent matter , especially if it be not digested to a whiteness .	Then for the Taste of Urine ; that naturally it is saltish and sulphureous ; and that it is altered by the mixture of certain humors abounding in the body ; which of what kind they be , is discernable by the Taste , to be made by the Patient himself , and to be told to the Physician .

When evaporated , this solution yields a brown resin , emitting , while fused , the distinct and nearly unmixed odour of common colophony .	As I had every reason to believe that in this state it is largely adulterated , I did not subject the resin thus obtained to any further examination .

This fossil body is a true resin of a brown colour , giving with cold alcohol a brown solution , having a peculiar unpleasant odour , and a disagreeable exceedingly bitter taste .	In the same paper I inserted also two analyses of this substance , which gave per cent .

The resin thus obtained retained its natural pale colour and peculiar odour , melted at 2120 FAHR .	, was brittle when cold , and when broken up its particles showed little tendency to cohere .

This resin has the characteristic odour of the gum resin , and the property which the natural product also possesses of becoming purple when exposed to the sun ' s rays .	Laid as a thin coating upon paper , the pure resin is much more sensible to the sun ' s rays than the resin of guiacum , and affords a much more beautiful colour .

When completely burned , the resin employed in the following analyses left 0 * 18 per cent .

As the resin , when heated gently over the lamp , and kept for a length of time in fusion , approached in composition to a formula containing nine of oxygen ( see fourth analysis above ) , I heated a second quantity very gently under the same circumstances , and kept it in fusion for six hours ; there was no frothing ; the resin nearly lost its smell , and became slightly darker in colour .	It was more brittle , and the fragments showed still less tendency to cohere than before .

Along with the alcohol a volatile oil escaped into the atmosphere , which diffused a powerful odour through the room , and which as it came forth from the mouth of the flask affected the eyes , like the fresh juice of the onion .	After this prolonged boiling the smell nearly disappeared , and on cooling the solution , the greater part of the resin subsided slowly in the form of a yellow powder , the supernatant liquid remaining turbid for many days .

The yellow powder dissolved readily , largely , and without residue , in cold alcohol .

ro8058	Perfumes	Musk									Of the reasonableness of which Conjucture the Subject of this Paper seems no contemptible Instance .	Musk , and other Perfumes of the same Tribe , have been long celebrated as excellent Antispasmodies ; but , as they are usually ordered in very small Quantities , they are seldom found to answer the Expectations of the Prescriber .	The Mistake seems to have taken its Rise from hence ; That most Persons imagining ( a ) Account of some Experiments on Mrs .

Most of the Writers on Pharmacy seem extremely cautious about the Use of Musk ; and therefore direct it only in exceeding small Quantities .

I always chuse to give it in a Bolus , if that Form be not disagreeable to the Patient ; because the Perfume in that Way is not near so strong as in any other : Indeed when given in a large Quantity , it is rather fetid than fragrant ; and I never yet met with any hysterical Person , how averse soever to Perfumes , but could take it in that Form without Inconvenience .	I cannot deny but I have once or twice prescribed Musk , and not found the usual Success after repeated Doses ; but this , upon a more exact Scrutiny , I found was owing only to some Sophistication of that which had been used : For , after having tried three or four Doses from one Shop without Success , upon sending for the same Quantity as had been before ordered , from another Person , whose Musk I had before experimented , I found the very first Dose answer as usual .
ro8058	Smell|Odour	Musk|it|its	the least|so exceedingly subtle							that many of them faint away|as	Believing this Theory to be just , so far as it goes , I readily concluded , that a Medicine capable of relaxing the nervous System could not fail of relieving it from the above - mention ' d Effects of Irritation , and thereby putting a Stop to Convulsions , opening the constricted Passages of Nature , moderating the Velocity city of the Blood , and procuring Sleep ; imagining also , that , by the same soothing Quality , the Juices themselves might , not improbably , be rendered more mild and innocent when impregnated with the Medicine .	And such a Medicine I judged Musk to be , on account of its known , and almost instantaneous , Effects on Persons of a lax Habit ; whose Nerves are so suddenly slackened , and the Motion of their Blood so diminished by the least Smell of it , that many of them faint away : Besides , its Odour is so exceedingly subtle , as to penetrate thro ' the closest Substances ; and may therefore be supposed easily to pervade the minutest Vessels of the human Body , and to diffuse its softening balsamic Virtue thro ' all the Juices thereof .	The Arrack seemed also a very proper Vehicle for the Musk ; not only as they make together a very agreeable Bitter , but also because inflammable Spirits resist Putrefaction , and also , in some measure , coagulate animal Juices , which are not already corrupted ; by which Effects the too much rarefied Blood is condensed , and hindered from putrefying further ; while the bad Juices , being separated from the sound , are plentifully thrown off by the Passages , which the Musk has relaxed , and opened for them .

It is exceedingly soluble in water , much less so in alcohol , and not at all in ether .

The fluid that had been positively electrified had the strong smell of oxymuriatic acid , and copiously precipitated nitrate of silver ; the other portion of fluid affected turmeric , and left by evaporation a substance which seemed to be a mixture of lime and soda , A part of a specimen of compact zeolite , from the Giant ' s Causeway , which by analysis had given 7 parts in loo of soda , had a small cavity made in it ; it was immerged in pure water in a crucible of platina , and electrified in the same manner as the cube of Carrara marble , mentioned in page g .	In less than two minutes the water in the cavity had gained the property of changing the colour of turmeric ; and in half an hour the solution was disagreeably alkaline to the taste .

A small plant of mint , in a state of healthy vegetation , was made the medium of connection in the battery , its extremities being in contact with pure water ; the process was carried on for lo minutes : potash and lime were found in the negatively electrified water , and acid matter in the positively electrified water , which occasioned a precipitate in solutions of muriate of barytes , nitrate of silver , and muriate of lime .

A smell of sulphuretted hydrogen was at first given out abundantly : this was soon followed by the odour of sulphurous acid , while at the same time sulphur was deposited .	The solution being filtered and evaporated to dryness , left g5 - 3 grains of common salt , equivalent to 13 ' 49 grains of soda .

If we concentrate the solution sufficiently , it shoots into large transparent crystals of hyposulphite of soda .

As to the finding out the Calamine , which I think the first thing to inform you of , the Groovers tell me there is no certainty at all , but that it is a mere Lottery : They are neither certain of it from the Surface of the Earth , which , as they observe , gives little or no signs thereof ; sometimes they say an oily Steam and Smell arises out of the Earth where they guess some Mines to be , but not Calamine ; nor from the Nature of the Ground , it being found sometimes in Meadows , sometimes in Arable , sometimes in Pasture ; and as I have observed , most commonly in barren and rocky Ground : Neither from the Colour or Taste of the Waters running thereabouts , they being much of the same Colour , Taste , Clearness and Wholsomness with other Water : Nor from the withering of the Grass upon the Superficies of the Earth , or the Leaves of the Trees , they being as fresh where Calamine lies , as in any other place .	But this I observe , that they always dig for it upon , or near the Hills ; for they expect none in those Grounds which have no Communication with Hills .

The forms of the surrounding orbital convolutions themselves , including the proper supraorbital ( it ) , are so broad and simple , that their subordinate divisions , which are so complex in the European brain , can hardly be said to exist .

The Soil in general is sandy : I had designed , and I think it might be worth a Critical Remark , to observe , the Difference of Soils seem appropriated to the several sorts of Tobacco : for there is not only the two distinct sorts of a Sweet - scented , and Aranoko Tobacco , but of each of these be several sorts much different , the Seeds whereof are known by distinct Names , they having given them the Names of those Gentlemen most famed for such sort of Tobacco , as of Prior - seed , & amp ; c .

The goodness of Tobacco I look on primarily consists in the volatility of its Nitre : And hence the sandy Grounds that are most impregnated therewith , and whose Nitrous Salt is most volatile , for such Grounds are quickliest spent , yield Tobacco ' s that have the richest Scent , and t ~ at shortly becomes a pleasant Smoke ; whereas , in Tobacco that grows on stiff Ground , the Salts seem more fixed , and locked up in the Oil , so that whilst new , it is very heady and strong , and requires some time for its Salts to free themselves , and become volatile ; which it manifests , by its having an Urinous Smell .	The same Reason satisfies , why Tobacco that grows on low Lands as far as the Salts , tho ' the Plant be never overflowed with Salt Water , yet the Ground that seeds the Plant being impregnated with Salt Water , that Tobacco smoaks not pleasantly , and will scarcely keep Fire , but do all that a Man can , will oft go out , and gives much trouble in frequent lighting the Pipe , ' till after it has been kept some considerable time : which may be assigned to the fixeder Saline Particles of the Marine Salt in these Plants , which require more time ever they be rendered volatile .

Now I said , that the Sweet - scented Tobacco most in vogue , which was most famed for its Scent , was that that grew on sandy Land ; which is true , if you would smoke it whilst new , or whilst only two or three Years old ; but if you keep the stiff Land Tobacco , which is generally a Tobacco of great Substance five or six Years , it will much excel : for tho ' the sandy Land Tobacco abound with a volatile Nitre at first , yet the stiff Land Tobacco abounds with a greater quantity of Nitre , only that it is locked up in its Cyl at first , and requires more time to extricate itself , and become volatile ; but the Pine - wood Land having little of the NitroSulphurious Sulphurious Particles , neither is , nor ever will make any thing of a rich Smoke .

In a short time it became highly putrid and offensive : after macerating a few hours in fresh water , the saline particles in its composition began to separate , large flakes separated from its surface , and I was convinced , that if the maceration had been continued , the whole of the outer part would have crumbled away ; it was therefore suffered to dry , and the putrid effluvia gradually went off .	As a proof that animal matter abounded , the calculus not having been protected from the flies , maggots were produced in it at the end of a fortnight , which were destroyed by washing it with spirits .

As to the Inundation it was surprising ; it tore up much of the Road and Street from the Church to the Bridge , and made Pits , in some places several Yards deep , threw down part of a Barn and a Stable , both of them lately built , it pushed into most of the Houses in the Town ; the Water , in some , was as high as the Soles of the Windows , and blocked up the Door of one House with Gravel almost to the very top ; and if it had continued with that violence half an Hour longer , most of the Town had been in the utmost danger : Several Persons were in great danger , but only one Woman drowned ; she was hurried away with the violence of the Stream , and not found till the 4th day after : It removed the Bole of a large Oak ( now sold for about 4 Nobles ) several Yards ; bore down the most part of 4 Wood Bridges ; and has left at the end of the great Stone Bridge , or within about 100 Yards of it , as much Gravel , & amp ; c .

Upon applying heat to the sulphur thus blackened , I have perceived an hepatic smell .	This blackened sulphur is not entirely dissolved , like pure sulphur , by being boiled in caustic alkali , but a black powder remains .

Its greatest resemblance to hemlock is in the spring , before the stalks of the leaves of the hemlock are interspersed with purple spots ; and therefore , at that season , more easily mistaken for it ; though , even then , the leaves of the hemlock smell much stronger , are more minutely divided , and are of a deeper green colour , than those of the cow - weed .	Afterwards , indeed , they are more easily distinguished , as the Cicutaria flowers at the end of April and beginning of May , and the Cicuta not till June , when the other is past : to say nothing of the flowering stalk of the cow - weed being furrowed , and somewhat downey ; and that of the hemlock , smooth , even , and always spotted .

This , however , is easily distinguished from hemlock , by its leaves being of the colour and shape of parsley , its flowering stalks having no purple or other spots , and not having the strong smell peculiar to hemlock .	To the two plants before - mentioned , may be added a third , which very frequently , more especially about London , grows along , and is mixed , with the hemlock .

It may be distinguished then from it , by the leaves of the myrrhis being more finely cut , of a paler green colour , and , though they have somewhat of the hemlock smell , are far less strong , and have no spots .	This plant flowers in April , and the seeds are ripe before the hemlock begins to flower ; and these seeds are cylindrical , rough , and terminate in an oblong point .

The leaves of hemlock are most fit for medicinal purposes , as being in their greatest perfection , when collected in dry weather , from the middle of May to the time that their flowering stems begin to shoot ; as by that time the plants will have felt the effects of the warm sun , have acquired an highly virose smell , and the stems of the leaves are covered with purple spots , an argument of the exaltation of their juices : and we should be attentive here to give them all these advantages , as three degrees of latitude , and other circumstances of soil and situation , may occasion a very sensible difference in the qualities of the same plant ; an instance of which occurs in the plant under consideration , and may be one of the causes , why the effects of the hemlock have not been such here , as we are assured they are at Vienna ; viz .

This latter , on distillation , presented the characters of a mixture from which it was impossible to isolate a product with a constant boiling - point .

After a digestion of about ten hours , the transformation is complete ; a brown solid matter is formed , having the appearance of paracyanogen , together with a yellowish oily layer possessing in a marked manner the odour of the isomers of the nitriles .	As several preliminary experiments gave indications of a rather complicated reaction , and as it would have been difficult for me readily to obtain sufficient substance by operating in sealed tubes , I performed the experiment in the amylic series , supposing that the higher boiling - point of the iodide of amyl would render it more easy of attack .

I have not yet completely examined the products boiling at a higher temperature , but everything seems to show that they consist , partly at least , of capronitrile .

The first Thing I tried was boring very little holes in a piece of Lead , fixed in a Pot , and sowing the Seeds thereon ; I found they would sprout , but as the Water evaporated , filling in fresh moved the Seeds from their places , that they could not fix themselves to turn their Radicle down into the Water ; I then tried Tow or Hemp , and spread it on the Lead , which I found answer the Purpose of supporting the Seed , which by that means grew , and the Radicle taking hold of the Tow , it was enabled to throw up its Plume or Shoot ; I then tried several sorts of small Seeds , and found they would all grow ; tho ' I made the Experiment about Christmas ; but I found the Tow discoloured the Water , and gave an offensive smell , and that the Seed did not thrive kindly : I then tried Wool and Cotton , the Cotton being too boyant , would not so well answer the Purpose ; but Wool , when it is just buried in Water , being like a Jelly , and not drying so soon on the Top , even though the Water has left it , entirely answers the Purpose as well as sowing them in the Earth ; and if the Seed be good , will keep clean for two or three Months ; for this way of sowing will discover whether the Seed be mixed with old Seed ( as those bought at a Seed - shop generally are .	) I sowed several sorts of Sallad - Seeds in this way , and they came to as great perfection as those of the same kind raised in Hot - beds : and thus they may be produced in any Room or Garret , early in the Spring , and so on till late in Autumn , till the cold Weather comes in , and afterwards in the middle of Winter , in a Room where a constant Fire is kept .

I therefolte worked the dou13ler sn that part of it , and after a very few turns it becatne electrified negatively , rather against my expectation I then tried the other end of the school , which , by the door being wide open , was less liable to retain any noxious effluvsum , and there the doubler g ; ave pos tive electric tie .	After this I tried it ill the schoolmasterts parlour , svllere it was pUsitive also .

The floor of the large or long ward had been waslled , and the boards vere still wet ; the windows in the east side , and the large orae in the snuth etad , were all open ; therefore there was but very little oSensive smell in the south end of this ward , and here the doubler became electrified positively : but the great window in the north end of this svard being close shut up , caused a sensible closeness itl tlqe air , accompanied with a slight smell ; and in this end of the ward the doubler gave negative electricity .

December 6th , I observed in the gardela a heap of the loppings and leaves of shrubs , in a state of putrefaction , which ilzsluced me to examine their volatile effluvium with the doubler , which I placed upon the lleap , and on working it , it became possessed of a weak laegative electricity ; for it required more than thirty turns of the revolving plate to effect a goocl charge , whereas in the privy ( which is at a small distance from the heap olileaves ) the doubler became strongly charged with less than half that lUotnber of turtls , and with the same kind of electricity .

This , iadeed , I expected would have been the case becallse I have always obse - rved the doubler to give negative electricity ii1 a privy , but that the rotten leaves should be able to maintain that electric state in the open air , is truly woncl : erful , when it is considered that the surrotlnding atrnospherical electricwity was of the positive kind , and rather strongly so , both by the doubler and the high pointed rod .

In order to be fuly satisfied in this matter I determ illed to try it 011 a large - dunghill , whence a greater quantity of putrid effluvium must ascend .	I also resolved to 1nake the experil1lelat when the air vas sharp and frosty , because then the atmospheric electricity is not only of the positive kind , but unifortnly the same in all places , - from the surface of ancontaminated earth to any height ^ ^ re Ca11 gO .

As I perceived no smell in this close hothbuse , I am inclined to attribute the negative electric state of the vapour to the heat of the fire and vigollr of the plants , which possibly xuay absorb the fluid faster than it could get in through the floor , which is renderod Yery dry by flues that lie on three sides of it .	The powder , after it was grown cold , appeared on the surface to be of a pale reddish colour ; but was not in the least altered underneath .

Two ounces of the black powder , which had been twice distilled , were set on a clear fire , in an iron ladle , and continually stirred from the time that the ladle grew red - hot , and the matter began to emit a heavy black stinking smoke , till no more smoke arose from it .	The calcined matter remaining in the ladle weighed two scruples , and seemed to be a kind of bole earth .
ro8287	smell	of sulphur	strong			in the street					It continued up the street , perhaps along the leaden gutter , over the eves of the houses for thirty yards , as guess , and turned downward by the side of a leaden pipe made to convey the water from the top of the house , and tore a wooden case at the lower end of that pipe , cracked the wall near that place , and broke several Hh2 panes Read July 5 , panes of glass in the kitchen window next it .	The wall that was cracked was blackened , and there was a strong smell of sulphur in the street .	On the east side of the street , the lightning broke the south garret window of the bottom house , threw down the eastern flue of the chimney down to the roof of the house , and took away part of the western flue .

But under this second sort of sacks they found yet another long one , full of liquor , more yellow and liquid , and more elaborate , then that in the former ; of a different smell , and like to the yolk of an egg ; of which they write from Canada , that Castors use it to make themselves an appetite , when they want it , and that they squeese it out by pressing with their paws the bladder , which contains it ; and that the Savages anoint with it the Gins they set for these animals , to draw them thither .	Fourthly , his Testicles not fastned to the Back - bone , as several Authors affirm , but on the sides of the Os pubis about the groyne , altogether hid , and not appearing at all , no more than the penis , before the skin was removed .
ro8305	smell	of sulphur	very considerable			in Lord Tylney ' s apartments|in the apartment above	I|Monsieur de Saussure|I				I thought that an Indian cracker had been fired , and Monsieur de Saussure thought it the report of a pistol ; but hearing , amidst other confused cries and noises , a voice saying , Un fulmine , un fulmine ! we began to examine the gallery in which we were , and soon discovered that the gilding of the cornish had been affected , for in the corners , and at every junction , it was quite blackened ; those that had been sitting under the cornishes were covered with the shining particles of the varnish that went over the gilding , and which was thrown off in small dust , at the moment of the explosion .	There was a smell of sulphur in Lord Tylney ' s apartments , but not very considerable ; I thought there was more in the apartment above , which Monsieur de Saussure and I visited immediately after , and where we found the same operation had been performed on the gildings .	It is very certain that the profusion of gildings , which is remarkable in this house , and the bell - wires , prevented the lightning from making more use of the company to conduct it in its course .

The Bark of this Tree being burnt , yields a fine Perfume ; infused either in Wine or Water , it gives a grateful aromatic Bitter .	This is called Cortex Eleutheriae by others ; taking its Name from one of the Bahama Islands , corruptly called Ilathera instead of Eleutheria , or Liberty - Island , from the Greek Word ~ , liber , free .
ro8315	esfluvia|effluvia			in the Air					by a critical salivation		The second book treats of the diseases of the mouth and breast , where among other things we meet with a discourse concerning an infallible way of preserving a man from infection though he converse constantly with all sorts of those who are infected , the way is no more than forbearing to swallow the Saliva , which at any ill smell is raised by nature , on purpose to be ejected , the suppositions that confirm this opinion are chiefly , the fermenting nature of contagion .	This contagion chiefly propagated by esfluvia in the Air ; These effluvia are readily imbibed by the Saliva , which thus impregnated and swallowed , must needs communicate them to the body ; to which may be annexed the observation of a Consumption cured by a critical salivation .	He treats very largely of the nature and cure of a Peripneumonia , and of its difference from a Pleurisy ; of all diseases of the lungs , as Gangrene , Schirrus , Vomica and Stones frequently found in them , a case of which latter is subjoyned of one who expectorating many of different shapes and sizes , was eased from a dyspnaea under which he almost mortally laboured .
ro8325	Smell	of Sulphur	strong					for a good while after			I observed there were many Holes in the Ground , one in the middle of the Bigness of a Man ' s Skull , and five or six smaller Holes round about it , of the Bigness of a Man ' s Fist , and so deep ( especially the biggest ) as not to be fathomed by what long Switches or Sticks they had at hand .	I did not hear that any was so curious as to make any farther Search : It was observed , that the green Grass was perfectly burnt near the Holes , and a strong Smell of Sulphur remained thereabouts for a good while after .	Note that we had a terrible rainy Night before , with much Lightning and great Thunder - Claps , which we have very frequently in Jamaica , often killing Cattle in the Fields .

ro8352	smell|one		sulphureous				I|a person|he	just before	On entering the church		The western side of the tower was rent from almost the top to the bottom , the crack not in a strait line , but irregular , and from one to five inches wide ; the south - east pinnacle split into a thousand pieces , and scattered all over the spacious church - yard and church - town ; two of the battlements on the western , and four on the eastern and southern sides of the tower struck off ; and every one of the windows of the church , ( excepting one in the jet - out north - isle ) shattered to pieces , presented a most dismal prospect .	On entering the church , I felt a sultry heat ; but there was no sulphureous smell , though a person present said , that he had very plainly perceived one just before .	It is difficult to say in what direction the force proceeded , I apprehend it must have penetrated the tower , through the middle of the arch over the belfry door , which , though locked and strongly bolted , was burst open ; the center of the arch is divided , and the top stone of that remarkably fine one over the window cracked athwart : the lightning must therefore have passed directly up the tower , through the midst of the wall , the outside of which has the exact appearance of being battered by cannon - ball , and is quite bulged out between the first and second ring .

In its appearance , odour , and taste , as likewise in its deportment with acids and with solvents generally , the brominated base obtained from acetylbromophenylamide resembles perfectly the bromphenylamine produced from bromisatin , a specimen of which I obtailed from Dr .

The Membrane of the Stomach extremely flaccid and very thin , appearing black and ~ , and upon taking it out within twenty four hours after death ( thoty ' d at both ends very close ) sent forth such an intolerable sour rancid sent , that the strongest double Aquafortis ( to which it might best be compared ) could not prove so troublesome and offensive to the smell .	The Lungs were distended to the uttermost with a purulent froth .

It is not improbable that by one or both of these methods the pestilentiai Effluvia of an infected Air , the Arsenical Exhalation of a damp , and the nitro - sulphureous steam ( much like the scent of Spirit of Nitre ) arising from burning charcoal do often act such sudden and fatal Tragedies .	For if we reflect on the membranous substance of the Lungs , the infinite number of Vesicles they are composed of , how that in every assignable point these vesicles are adorned with capillary blood - vessels , so that the point of a needle every where draws blood ; if we calculate the inward Concave superficies of the Lungs , supposed unfolded and spread out into a plain , which must needs exceed the outward apparent Convex above an hundred times , and consequently consider the vast surface of Blood each moment exposed to the Air : Lastly , if we allow the Ingress of the Air into the Blood upon breathing , which ~ any now deny , I say if we reflect on these things , it is easy to imagine how suddenly mischievous any coagulative poisonous steam may prove , since together with the Air ' twill be diffused through all the Blood contained in the Lungs at the very Instant of Inspiration , and , ( whether it be austere or acid or both , or what other name Physicians may please to give it ) joins it self per minima with almost each particle of Blood , and ( as steams of hot lead ( they say ) fix Quicksilver into a solid ) presently destroys all Fluidity , stuffs the Lungs and Heart with an immovable and almost mortisi ' d Mass ; puts a final stop to the Circulation , and so in a moment breaks off the Series and Thread of Life .

Even at the common temperature , much more so by ebullition , the solution of the free base becomes pink , violet , and finally ruby - red , and deposits after some time a brown powder , a peculiar odour like that of the heliotrope being at the same time evolved .	I have not examined more minutely the changes which the pyridine - compound thus undergoes .

And then that I think it observable , that there is a very strong offensive smell , ranker then that of Sepulchers , which I have observed in some Mines , the Work - men telling me , that that is one of the chief signs of a rich Mine .	To conclude , I shall presume to give you some of my thoughts concerning the so much discoursed of Transmutation of Metals ; concerning which , I am of opinion , that that Change is erroneously apprehended by many , imagining that the whole imperfect mettal is totally transformed into the more perfect by the substance mixed with it ; whereas the mixture added to the melted mettal , joins it self , ( as I conceive ) to those parts , which being homogeneal , symbolize together with the nature of the more perfect , whereby the pure metalline parts are separated from the other heterogeneal impure Sulphures , which together , with other causes , did hinder nature in the Mine from concocting that substance into the perfecter Mettal .

Upon making Incisions in her Legs and Arms , Five or Six Inches long , I found the outer Laminae of the Bones soft , and become perfectly membranous , about the Thickness of the Peritoneum , containing ( instead of a bony Substance ) a Fluid of the Consistence of Honey , when it is thick , of a reddish Colour , not at all disagreeable to the Smell : There was no Appearance of any Bones in her Leg and Arms , except near the Joints , which were in part dissolved , and what remained were very soft , and full of Holes , like a Honey - comb : Also the Bones of the Head would easily give way to the Pressure of the Finger .	It is remarkable , that those Parts of the Bones that are the most compact and hard , were first dissolved , while their Heads , which are more spongy and soft , had not so entirely lost their Substance .

The compound of oxygene and iodine when entirely freed by heat from the compound of oxygene and chlorine , appears as a white semi - transparent solid ; it has no smell , but a strong astringent sour taste .	Its specific gravity is considerable , for it rapidly sinks in sulphuric acid .

He was one day walking upon the sea side , and seeing a great number of apples upon the ground , was charmed with their beautiful colours , and sweet smell , resembling that of the apple called d ' apis : he took and eat of them , without knowing what they were ; he found they had a subacid taste ; and having eaten a couple of dozen of them , he filled his pockets , and came home , eating the rest as he came .	The Negroes , that saw him eat this cruel fruit , told him it was mortal ; upon which he ceased to eat them , and threw away the rest .

The smell also of the liquid which is condensed on the inner surface of a glass receiver , in which oil gas or coal gas has been mixed with chlorine , denotes the presence of chloric ether , evidently however mingled with the odour of some other fluid , which seems to me to bear most resemblance to that of spirit of turpentine .	This part of the subject is well worthy of farther investigation ; but having devoted to the enquiry all the leisure which I am now able to command , I must remain satisfied at present with such conclusions as are safely deducible from the foregoing investigation .
ro8427	Smell	Baulme				a Well					Neither does any there remember when , and upon what Occasion it first began .	The flaming Well near Wig an seems to proceed from a Cause much like this , in which you may boil an Egg , and upon the approaching of a lighted Candle it takes Fire , both seem to proceed from a Naphtha or subtle Bitumen , only that in a hotter Country , and being in a dryer Soil , is more Subtle and inflammable ; just as the Petroleum which is found in Italy is a white - like Spirit of Turpentine ; and is more penetrating than the Petroleum which is to be found in the Northern Countries ; an Instance of which we have in a Well two Miles distant from Edinburgh , called the Baulme - Well , of a black red colour , and very thick , but being distilled , does in Colour , Taste and Smell , ~ that of Italy .	What Lonicerus says of the Naphtha is not improper for this Place , viz .

This spontaneous Accension of the Naphtha seems to be made out by the Smell that our Bitumen near Edenburgh yields , being most like Coal - Smoak .	There are three such Fires on the same Hills that are extinguished in the Summer , but burn in the Winter .

This City and Country round about , is filled with Reports of Raining Wheat about Warminster , and other Places within Six or Eight Miles of it , and many believe it ; I have procured several Parcels of it , and carefully examined them , and find it to be the seeds of Ivy - Berries , which from Towers and Churches , Chimneys , Walls and high Buildings , were lately by very fierce Tempests of Wind and Hail , driven away from the holes , chinks and other parts where Birds had brought them , especially Sterlings and Choughs : It were to little purpose to tell you the Prodigious Stories which have been made of it ; among many others , it was confidently affirmed ( and backed by several , who affirm they had seen it ) that those Grains were found in the Hail , as Seeds in Comfits : I do here acquaint you with it ( upon Notice I had of some who have sent several Parcels of it to your Society , with strange Relations of it ) to the end you may inform them of the Truth ; For I have by all the ways I can Imagine examined and compared them with the Seeds of Ivy Berries , by the taste , smell , size , and Figure ; with the assistance of Magnifying Glasses , viewing them in both the superficial and inward Parts .	This perhaps they may have discovered before this comes to their Hands , if they desire farther Satisfaction concerning it , I shall be ready to serve them , & amp ; c .

The insoluble part was unfortunately thrown away ; but to the solution we added muriatic acid : on the addition of the acid , there was a strong smell of hepar sulphuris , and a copious precipitate , which , on being examined by a microscope , appeared to consist of pellucid crystals , without the smallest appearance of sulphur .	This precipitation , being exposed to heat , did not smell in the least like sulphur ; it was not in the least inflammable .

The foregoing experiments occasioning some doubt of sulphur ' s being contained in vitrous silver ore , we endeavoured to investigate it by other means ; and after several experiments , we made the following one , which seems conclusive .

In the first experiment , when I poured the fuming liquor into the oil , inflammation immediately took place , with violent ebullition and production of dense reddish fumes .	I have used other specimens of oil of turpentine , expecting a similar inflammation , but without its occurrence , theugh there has been in every instance a considerable action .

The mixture of the two being made in a retort connected with mercury , no gas was generated , oxide of tin appeared to be formed , and a viscid oil was produced , which , like the fat oils , left a permanent stain on paper , and had little smell or taste , and which , digested with alcohol , imparted something which occasioned a permanent cloudiness on the admixture of water , and an odour to me not unlike that of artificial camphor .	The action of the liquor of Libavius on the oil of turpentine is worthy of further inquiry .

As there is no tide there is no slimy shore , which might send forth putrid vapours at low - water ; and if there were a tide , our shore is one continued rock , on which there is not any putrescent substance .	Indeed the rocks are so free from filth , that after a strong wind has raised the sea - water , and carried it into cavities hollowed in the rock by storms , it drys there into pure white salt .

Where land is thus abundantly watered and closely planted with succulent vegetables , many parts of these vegetables , as well as the insects which feed on them , will be liable to putrify ; and a putrid vapour may be thence exhaled in the evening especially , and during the night , when there seldom is wind to carry them off .	Wherever the inhabitants can find a proper depth of mould , within a convenient distance of a market , so many sources of putrid exhalations are formed .

When houses are built on the soft Cantoon stone , the rain that falls without soaks through it ; and if there are no means of carrying it off , it remains in the stone , becomes putrid , gradually exhales , and thus becomes highly prejudicial to health .	I might quote several instances of families dying in consequence of such putrid moisture ; but shall rest satisfied with one , because it became an object of general observation .

In order to remedy this inconveniency , the floor was taken up , and a stench arose which the workmen could scarcely bear , and changed the colour of every metallic substance about them .	People were impressed with so strong a prejudice against the house , that it remains uninhabited and an useless building .

This sulphur , which stuck to the neck of he retort , had an oily appearance ; and the retort , when opened , had not only the smell of the volatile sulphureous acid , which usually accompanies the sublimation of sulphur , but it had also the strong empyreumatic smell which peculiarly appertains to burnt oils ; and it retained this smell for several days .	It has been remarked before , that the salt separable from the sulphur water was of a brownish colour ; and others , who have analysed this water , have met with a brown substance , which they knew not what to make of ; both which appearances may be attributed to the oil , the existence of which was rendered so manifest by the sublimation here mentioned .
ro8464	smell	it	sulphureous								This I can well believe , for I ordered a piece of shale to be broken off from the bottom of the fourth well ; it was split , as shale generally is , into several thin pieces , and was covered with a whitish crust .	Being laid on a hot iron , in a dark room , it cracked very much , and exhibited a blue flame and sulphureous smell .	If the water happens to stand a few days in any of the wells , without being disturbed , there is found at the bottom a black sediment ; this black sediment also marks the course of the water which flows from the well , and it may be esteemed characteristic of a sulphur water .
ro8464	smell	The white scum|of sulphur							being gently dried		Doctor SHORT had long ago observed , that both the black sediment , and the white scum , gave clear indications , on a hot iron , of their containing sulphur : I know not whence it has come that his accuracy has been questioned in this point ; certain I am , that on the repetition of his experiments I found them true .	The white scum also , which is found sticking on the grass over which the water flows , being gently dried , burns with the flame and smell of sulphur .	From what has been said it is clear , that sulphur is found at Harrogate , sticking to the bason into which the water springs ; sublimed upon the stones which compose the edifice surrounding the well ; adhering to the sides of the tubs in which the water stands ; subsiding to the bottom of the channel in which the water runs ; and covering the surface of the earth , and of the blades of grass , over which it flows .

In the Chemical Essay before referred to , I have shown , that the air separable from the lead ore of Derbyshire , or from Black - Jack , by solution in the acid of vitriol , impregnates common water with the sulphureous smell of Harrogate water ; and I have also shown that the bladder fucus or sea - wrack , by being calcined to a certain point , and put into water , not only gives the water a brackish taste , but communicates to it , without injuring its transparency , the smell , taste , and other properties of Harrogate water .	Professor BERGMAN impregnated water with a sulphureous taste and smell , by means of air separated by the vitriolic acid from hepar sulphuris , made by fusion of equal weights of sulphur and pot - ashes , and from a mass made of three parts of iron filings melted with two of sulphur ; and he found also , that Black - Jack and native Siberian iron yielded hepatic air , by solution in acids .

DARWI N , in his ingenious Account of an artificial Spring of Water , published in the first part of the LXXVth volume of the Philosophical Transactions , mentions his having perceived a slight sulphureous smell and taste in the water of a well which had been sunk in a black , loose , moist earth , which appeared to have been very lately a morass , but which is now covered with houses built upon piles .	In the bog or morass above - mentioned there is great plenty of sulphureous water , which seems to spring from the earth of the rotten wood of which that bog consists .

These facts are not sufficient to make us certain , that rotten wood is efficacious in impregnating water with a sulphureous smell ; because there are many bogs in every part of the world , in which no sulphureous water has ever been discovered .	Nor , on the other hand , are they to be rejected as of no use in the inquiry ; because wood , at a particular period of its putrefaction , or when situated at a particular depth , or when incumbent on a soil of a particular kind , may give an impregnation to water , which the same wood , under different circumstances , would not give .

The bilge water , usually found at the bottom of ships which are foul , is said to smell like Harrogate water : I at first supposed , that it had acquired this smell in consequence of becoming putrid in contact with the timber on which it rested , and this circumstance I considered as a notable support to the conjecture I had formed of rotten wood being , under certain circumstances , instrumental in generating the smell of Harrogate water .	But this notion is not well founded ; for the bilge water is , I suppose , salt water ; and Dr .

However , as neither the salt in sea water , nor that of calcination sea - wrack , nor calcined bay salt , are any of them absolutely free from the admixture of bodies containing the vitriolic acid , a doubt still remains , whether the sulphureous exhalation , here spoken of , can be generated from substances in which the vitriolic acid does not exist .

This difference may be attributed , either to the different qualities of the different pieces of shale which he tried , or to the calcination of the first being pushed to a certain definite degree ; for the combination of the principles on which the smell depends may be produced by one degree of heat , and destroyed by another .
ro8464	smell								by one degree of heat		He burned several other pieces of shale , but none of them stunk so strong as the first .	This difference may be attributed , either to the different qualities of the different pieces of shale which he tried , or to the calcination of the first being pushed to a certain definite degree ; for the combination of the principles on which the smell depends may be produced by one degree of heat , and destroyed by another .	I have mentioned , briefly , these properties of shale , because there is a stratum of shale extended over all the country in the neighbourhood of Harrogate ; several beds of it may be seen in the stone quarry above the sulphur wells ; many of the brooks about Harrogate run upon shale , and the sulphur wells spring out of it .
ro8464	smell	of honey							after a long series of very dry weather		But whatever impregnation shale when calcined , or otherwise decomposed to a particular degree , may give to the water which passes over it , it must not be concluded , that shale in general gives water a sulphureous impregnation ; since there are many springs , in various parts of England , arising out of shale , in which no such impregnation is observed .	I forgot to mention , in its proper place , that having visited the bog , so often spoken of , after a long series of very dry weather , I found its surface , where there was no grass , quite candied over with a yellowish crust , of tolerable consistency , which had a strong aluminous taste , and the smell of honey .	BERGMAN speaks of a turf found at Helsingberg in Scania , consisting of the roots of vegetables , which was often covered with a pyritous cuticle , which , when elixated , yielded alum ; and I make no doubt , that the Harrogate morass is of the same kind .
ro8476	smell	The piece of Whales Flesh	very good								From the Particles of Blood my thoughts wandered to those of the Flesh of a Whale , whereupon I desired some that were concerned in the Fishing to bring me a piece of Whale ' s Flesh , imagining that the Flesh - Particles of the said Fish were no bigger than those of a Horse or Cow , and that the bulk or largeness of a Whale consisted only in the multitude of number of Particles .	The piece of Whales Flesh which was brought me had no very good smell , by reason of its being almost putrified ; I cut it thro cross - ways , in order to separate the Flesh - Particles according to their length ; and I must own , that according to the best of my judgment , I could discover no difference between the said Particles ( in their sight ) and those of a large Ox .	The reason why I compare a Whale with a great Ox , is , because I imagine that the Fibres in a great Ox are Kkkkkkkkkk not not more than those of a small one ; nay , even in a Calf , I do n ' t think that the Fibres are fewer in number , but only that they increase in bigness .
ro8490	smell	it	sulphureous						Calcined with powdered charcoal		It therefore contains no calcareous earth , as that earth would have been dissolved by the acids , and precipitated from them by the alkali .	Calcined with powdered charcoal , it contracted no sulphureous smell , and the acids had no more action upon it than before .	It therefore contains no gypseous matter , or combination of calcareous earth with vitriolic acid ; as that acid would have formed sulphur with the inflammable principle of the charcoal , and left the calcareous earth pure , or in a state of solubility by acids .
ro8490	smell	gypsum|calcareous earth	sulphureous						by calcination with charcoal powder		No crystallization was formed : the dry salt appeared merely alkaline as at first , and deliquiated in the air ; a further proof that this clay contains no gypseous matter ; for the vitriolic acid would have been absorbed by the alkali , and formed vitriolated tartar , a salt which neither liquefies in the air , nor dissolves easily in water , and which therefore would have crystallized long before the alkali became dry , or remained after its deliquiation .	A twentieth part of gypsum , ground with clay , was very distinguishable by both the foregoing processes ; producing a sulphureous smell , and calcareous earth by calcination with charcoal powder ; and crystals of vitriolated tartar by calcination with the same alkaline salt .	To separate the pure argillaceous part , or that matter which in all clays forms alum with the vitriolic acid , 240 grains of this clay were thoroughly moistened with oil of vitriol , boiled to dryness , and at last made nearly red - hot .

This bag being opened , there came out into the thorax a serous , fluid , void of smell , which being spread upon the table was found , as to figure , colour , and substance , much to resemble a cuttle fish ; nor do I doubt but some whimsical naturalists , who make it their business to surprise the common people , by the relation of miraculous events , would have declared that they saw part of the lungs changed into a cuttle fish .	After this digression concerning varieties in the structure of the heart , the author resumes his anatomy of the Squalus maximus , and notices , among the peculiarities of the urinary passages , that there is no proper urinary bladder , but a cavity comparatively small , that is common to the urine and semen ; since both the vasa differentia and ureters open into it at the distance of about four inches from each other .

Respecting the brain , it is remarked , that in the Squalus , as well as in fish in general , the cerebrum is wanting , unless the part from which the olfactory nerves arise be so called .	The eye is very small for the size of the fish ; its largest diameter being not more than three inches , and its shortest only one inch and three quarters .

In the same patient the appearance of the discharge is frequently varied by internal remedies , or by external applications ; but if we except the temporary variations produced by accidental circumstances , the cancerous ulcer is , in its advanced stage , very generally accompanied with a peculiar odour more highly fetid and offensive than that which is emitted by other malignant ulcers .	It is well known , that the cancerous matter occasions by its obsorption schirrous tumors of the lymphatic glands contiguous to the parts affected ; and that it gradually corrodes the branches of the larger blood - vessels , which have a peculiar power of resisting the action of other purulent discharges .
ro8506	odour	of the cancerous matter	peculiar	through the surrounding air							To one of these I added a solution of vegetable fixed alkali ; to the second , a little concentrated vitriolic acid ; and to the third , syrup of violets .	By the vegetable fixed alkali no sensible change was produced : upon the addition of the vitriolic acid , the liquor in the second glass acquired a deep brown colour , a brisk effervescence took place , and at the same time the peculiar odour of the cancerous matter was greatly increased , and diffused itself to a considerable distance through the surrounding air .	The syrup of violets communicated to the liquor in the third glass a faint green colour .
ro8506	fetor	the liquor|its	much increased|so considerable						Upon the addition of the acid		Suspecting that the effervescence in the preceding experiment might have arisen from a change which the matter underwent , in consequence of its having been kept some days before the trial was made , I repeated the experiment with a portion of reddish matter recently obtained from a cancerous penis .	Upon the addition of the acid , the liquor , as before , acquired a brown colour , its fetor was much increased , and a manifest effervescence took place , although it was not so considerable as in the former instance .	A portion of the same matter diffused through distilled water communicated a blue tinge to tincture of litmus , and a greenish cast to syrup of violets .
ro8506	odour	its			resemblance to hepatic|to any other species of air						When these mixtures were diluted with about twice their weight of distilled water , the brown tinge of the former entirely disappeared ; but the latter still retained its brown colour , although it was somewhat fainter than it had been upon the first addition of the acid .	The aerial fluid which was disengaged in the foregoing trials from the matter of cancer , by the vitriolic acid , appeared from its odour to have a nearer resemblance to hepatic than to any other species of air .	As it seemed , from its sensible qualities , to be a very active , and probably a deleterious principle , I endeavoured more particularly to enquire into its nature , and to compare it with common hepatic air .
ro8506	smell|odour	It|of the hepatic air	much		that of rotten eggs				during its combustion in the open air|when a solution of nitrated silver is dropped into water impregnated|by the addition of the nitrated silver		But before I relate the trials which were made with that view , it may not be improper briefly to mention the characters by which common hepatic air is distinguished .	It has a smell resembling that of rotten eggs ; it is inflammable , and during its combustion in the open air , sulphur is deposited ; it communicates a black colour to silver and copper , and a brownish tinge to lead and iron ; it is soluble in water , and when a solution of nitrated silver is dropped into water impregnated with it , the mixture becomes turbid , and a darkcoloured precipitate falls to the bottom ; by the addition of the nitrated silver , the odour of the hepatic air is rendered much fainter ; and it is entirely destroyed by concentrated nitrous , or by dephlogisticated marine acid .	To determine whether the aerial fluid contained in the cancerous matter possessed these properties , a portion of this substance was diffused through distilled water .
ro8506	smell	of a similar mixture of cancerous matter|of distilled water	fetid|much fainter								In a little time , an ash - coloured cloud was produced , which soon afterwards acquired a brownish purple hue , and at the end of two hours the colour of the mixture was changed to a deep brown .	The fetid smell was now rendered much fainter than that of a similar mixture of cancerous matter , and of distilled water , to which nitrated silver had not been added .	When a little concentrated nitrous acid was dropped into the mixture which had been thus altered by the addition of nitrated silver , a slight effervescence took place , the brown hue was instantly changed to an orange colour , and the fetid smell was abolished .
ro8506	smell		fetid						When a little concentrated nitrous acid was dropped|by the addition of nitrated silver		The fetid smell was now rendered much fainter than that of a similar mixture of cancerous matter , and of distilled water , to which nitrated silver had not been added .	When a little concentrated nitrous acid was dropped into the mixture which had been thus altered by the addition of nitrated silver , a slight effervescence took place , the brown hue was instantly changed to an orange colour , and the fetid smell was abolished .	The fetor was likewise entirely destroyed , when dephlogisticated marine acid was added either to cancerous matter in its separate state , or to a portion of that substance which had been previously mixed with nitrated silver .
ro8506	fetor								when dephlogisticated marine acid		When a little concentrated nitrous acid was dropped into the mixture which had been thus altered by the addition of nitrated silver , a slight effervescence took place , the brown hue was instantly changed to an orange colour , and the fetid smell was abolished .	The fetor was likewise entirely destroyed , when dephlogisticated marine acid was added either to cancerous matter in its separate state , or to a portion of that substance which had been previously mixed with nitrated silver .	By the foregoing properties the cancerous virus is distinguished from common pus : for when dilute vitriolic acid is added to common pus , no effervescence is produced ; and when a solution of nitrated silver is dropped into this substance previously diffused through distilled water , the mixture does not acquire a brown colour ; nor does any sensible precipitation take place for several hours .
ro8506	odour	of the cancerous matter		The water							The air and water were then briskly agitated together , and the phial being a second time inverted over distilled water , the cork was removed ; when it appeared by the heighth to which the water rose , that a part of the air had been absorbed .	The water contained in the phial was now found to be strongly impregnated with the odour of the cancerous matter , and a little nitrated silver being dropped into it , a purplish cloud , inclining to red , was produced .	It is proper to observe , that the change of colour upon the addition of the nitrated silver , in this experiment , was at first scarcely perceptible ; but in the course of a few minutes it became very distinct .
ro8506	fetid|fetid|odour	of cancerous matter	fetid|fetid	air					If heat be applied		The quantity of aerial fluid that can be thus extricated by the addition of the acid without the assistance of heat , is not very considerable .	If heat be applied , a larger portion of fetid air , having the odour of cancerous matter , may be disengaged ; but in that case it will be found to be mixed with vitriolic acid air .	With a view to obtain the former of these fluids in as pure a state as possible , the experiment was repeated in the following manner .
ro8506	smell|it	it	very fetid	the water	similar to that of the cancerous matter						The extremity of the tube being then introduced into the mouth of an inverted bottle containing water , and the flame of a candle being applied to the bottom of the proof , a quantity of air was expelled , which was received in the bottle .	This air , when it was first disengaged , rose in the form of white bubbles ; it had a very fetid smell , similar to that of the cancerous matter ; and the water which was impregnated with it occasioned a dark - brown precipitate in a solution of nitrated silver .	The crooked tube being separated from the proof , a very offensive white vapour , resembling in its odour the air extricated during the experiment , arose from the mixture , and continued to ascend for nearly half an hour .

The crooked tube being separated from the proof , a very offensive white vapour , resembling in its odour the air extricated during the experiment , arose from the mixture , and continued to ascend for nearly half an hour .	When to a portion of this smoking liquor , previously filtered , a little concentrated nitrous acid was added , the fetid smell was entirely destroyed , a slight effervescence took place , and a flaky substance that floated through the mixture was disengaged .

When to a portion of this smoking liquor , previously filtered , a little concentrated nitrous acid was added , the fetid smell was entirely destroyed , a slight effervescence took place , and a flaky substance that floated through the mixture was disengaged .	The foregoing experiments prove , in general , that the fetid odour of the matter of cancer is increased by the vitriolic , but entirely destroyed by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids ; that the aerial fluid , which is disengaged by the vitriolic acid , is soluble in water ; and that the solution tion deposits a reddish brown precipitate upon the addition of nitrated silver .

Whence it follows , that the cancerous matter contains a principle which has many of the properties of hepatic air , and which may perhaps not improperly be termed animal hepatic air .
ro8506	smell|odoriferous|odoriferous	of the cancerous matter	odoriferous|odoriferous				I		increased by the addition of the vitriolic acid		It seemed extremely probable , that the above - mentioned alkali was united to the aerial fluid with which the matter of cancer is impregnated .	Of the truth of this fact I was persuaded by observing , that the smell of the cancerous matter was greatly increased by the addition of the vitriolic acid : for I could scarcely avoid concluding , that this phenomenon arose from an union between the acid and alkali , in consequence of which the odoriferous principle was extricated by a superior attraction .	This conclusion will be confirmed by experiments to be recited in the sequel , which prove , that the volatile alkali is capable of entering into a chemical combination with the aerial fluid contained in the matter of cancer .
ro8506	smell	of the cancerous matter	peculiar	This portion of air							Two measures of it , mixed with one of nitrous air , occupied the space of a little less than two measures .	This portion of air was strongly impregnated with the peculiar smell of the cancerous matter .	The heat continuing to increase , the water began to boil , and a large quantity of aqueous vapour arose ; which , as soon as it came into contact with the common air , produced a white smoke .

The aqueous vapour in this part of the process was not mixed with any permanently elastic fluid .

The tube was now removed from the mercury , and the air that remained in it had a strong fetid smell , resembling that of burned bones .	It has been already observed , that before the water was entirely evaporated , the vapour had lost the odour of the cancerous matter , and had acquired that of animal substances recently boiled .

To discover whether other animal substances yield an aerial fluid , similar to that which was extricated in the foregoing experiment from the matter of cancer by means of heat , a portion of the flesh of the neck of a chicken was introduced into a small coated glass retort , which was gradually exposed to heat in a sand bath till it became red - hot .

A thin phlegm , of a yellowish colour , first came over : this was soon succeeded by a yellow empyreumatic oil , and at the same time a permanently elastic fluid , having an odour resembling that of burned feathers , began to be disengaged .

Its odour indeed was nearly similar to that of animal substances in a state of putrefaction .
ro8506	odour	Its			similar to that of animal substances				in a state of putrefaction		It is proper to observe , that the air extricated from the putrid veal had less of the empyreumatic smell than that which was disengaged from fresh animal substances .	Its odour indeed was nearly similar to that of animal substances in a state of putrefaction .	We learn from these experiments that the aerial fluids , which are extricated from fresh as well as from putrid animal substances by distillation , have nearly the same properties with that which is disengaged , by a similar process , from the matter of cancer .
ro8506	odour	it|it	fetid								Each of them appears to consist of two distinct fluids ; one of which is soluble , and the other insoluble , in water .	The portion that is insoluble burns with a lambent flame , and has all the characters of heavy inflammable air ; whereas the soluble part resembles the fluid which is extricated from cancerous matter by the vitriolic acid : it has a fetid odour , it decomposes nitrated silver , combines with caustic volatile alkali , and possesses many of the properties of common hepatic air .	There are several particulars , however , in which the animal and common hepatic air materially differ from each other .
ro8506	fetid|fetid|odours	they|their	fetid|fetid|not exactly similar								There are several particulars , however , in which the animal and common hepatic air materially differ from each other .	Although they are both fetid , yet their odours are not exactly similar .	When common hepatic air is decomposed by the concentrated nitrous or dephlogisticated marine acid , sulphur is separated ; but when animal hepatic air is decomposed by these acids , a white flaky matter is disengaged which is evidently an animal substance , because it becomes black by the addition of concentrated vitriolic acid .
ro8506	putrid|putrid		putrid|putrid								Hence it appears , that the air extricated from fresh beef by distillation does not contain sulphur ; for , if it had contained that substance , the sulphur , by its combustion with the pure air , would have been changed into the vitriolic acid , and the muriated barytes would have been decomposed .	I frequently repeated the preceding experiment with the air extricated , by distillation , from the putrid as well as from the fresh muscular fibres of animals ; but I could not , in any instance , discover the least vestige of the vitriolic acid .	The following experiments were made with a view more accurately analyse the airs which are disengaged from animal substances by heat , and to determine the products resulting from the union of these fluids with pure air .
ro8506	odour	of|of a|a thin|thin empyreumatic|empyreumatic oil|oil		a fluid	of|of a|a thin|thin empyreumatic|empyreumatic oil|oil						A similar experiment being made with the air disengaged towards the middle of the distillation , the part of it which was soluble in water was found to be to the part not soluble in that fluid as 2 to 3 .	Having suffered a separate portion of the air disengaged towards the end of the distillation to remain over mercury for seven hours , it was found gradually to diminish in bulk , and a fluid , which had the colour and the odour of a thin empyreumatic oil , was collected at the bottom of the jar * .	The air being now agitated with water , only one - eighth of it was absorbed .
ro8506	smelled	it	strongly		of animal hepatic air						It appeared from the experiment , that animal hepatic air , when it was absorbed by water , was not capable of being again disengaged by a heat which raised the water to the boiling temperature ; for , after the fixed air was expelled , the liquor in the proof was made to boil nearly half an hour , but no permanently elastic fluid could be disengaged .	The portion of the liquor which now remained had a faint yellow colour ; it smelled strongly of animal hepatic air , and deposited a brown precipitate upon the addition of nitrated silver .	It appears , therefore , that the soluble part of the air which is disengaged from the lean of animal substances by heat , consists of three distinct fluids ; of alkaline air , fixed air , and animal hepatic air .
ro8506	odour	of volatile vitriolic acid	strong						when hepatic and pure air were fired in equal bulks		The residue , which the distilled water did not absorb , was the phlogisticated air that existed in the pure air previously to the combustion .	From subsequent trials it appeared , that , when hepatic and pure air were fired in equal bulks , the residue had a strong odour of volatile vitriolic acid , and moreover contained a small proportion of undecomposed hepatic air .	These facts seem to prove , that the conversion of sulphur into volatile or fixed vitriolic acid depends upon the quantity of pure air with which it is supplied .
ro8506	odour	of the volatile vitriolic acid					I		constantly accompanies the combustion of hepatic with common air in open vessels|when concentrated nitrous acid is added to water impregnated with hepatic air|upon the addition of muriated barytes		From this , and the foregoing experiment , it appears , that when sulphureous hepatic is burned with atmospherical air , a part of the sulphur is changed into vitriolic acid , and the rest is precipitated ; but when it is burned with a sufficient quantity of pure air , the sulphur is wholly converted into vitriolic acid .	Agreeable to this conclusion , I have found that the odour of the volatile vitriolic acid constantly accompanies the combustion of hepatic with common air in open vessels ; and that when concentrated nitrous acid is added to water impregnated with hepatic air , the filtered liquor becomes turbid upon the addition of muriated barytes .	The quantity of pure air required to saturate sulphureous hepatic air , does not appear to correspound with the supposition that the last of these fluids consists of sulphur dissolved in light inflammable air : for sulphur , in order to its complete saturation , requires only 1 .

The substance , thus obtained , had a very fetid odour : it appeared to have a near resemblance to an animal oil which had become green by putrefaction .	It was , however , soluble in water , and the odour of the solution was increased by the vitriolic , and destroyed by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids .

ro8506	smell		fetid	the water							In the beginning of July , 1789 , about two ounces of veal , slightly putrid , was introduced into a large phial , which was filled with distilled water , and inverted over a quantity of the same fluid .	At the end of three days a few bubbles of air had appeared at the bottom of the phial ; the water had acquired a light brown colour , and emitted a fetid smell .	At the expiration of seven days we could perceive that the quantity of air at the bottom of the phial was manifestly increased , although its progress was very slow .
ro8506	smell	it	highly fetid	The water							At the expiration of seven days we could perceive that the quantity of air at the bottom of the phial was manifestly increased , although its progress was very slow .	The water , by the dissolution of a part of the veal , had now acquired the consistence of a thin mucus , its brown colour was somewhat deepened , and it emitted a highly fetid smell .	A little nitrated silver being dropped into a portion of this water , previously filtered , a dark brown precipitate was immediately produced .
ro8506	smell	Lime - water	fetid|slight						when concentrated nitrous acid was added		A little nitrated silver being dropped into a portion of this water , previously filtered , a dark brown precipitate was immediately produced .	Lime - water , mixed with another portion of it , occasioned an ash - coloured precipitate ; and when concentrated nitrous acid was added to a third portion , the fetid smell was destroyed , a slight effervescence took place , and a yellow flaky matter was disengaged .	At the end of seven weeks , a quantity of air , amounting to two and one - sixth dram measures was collected in the phial .

Two separate portions of distilled water being saturated with it , the first , upon the addition of nitrated silver , deposited a brown precipitate ; and the last , when it was mixed with lime - water , produced a brownish ash - coloured cloud .

The quantity of elastic fluid collected in this experiment was much greater than in the preceding one ; because in the preceding experiment , although the putrefaction advanced more rapidly , yet the fixed and hepatic air were absorbed by the water nearly as fast as they were disengaged from the putrid substance .
ro8506	putrid|putrid	substance	putrid|putrid								Its smell was putrid , but not very offensive .	The quantity of elastic fluid collected in this experiment was much greater than in the preceding one ; because in the preceding experiment , although the putrefaction advanced more rapidly , yet the fixed and hepatic air were absorbed by the water nearly as fast as they were disengaged from the putrid substance .	Hence it appears , that the aerial fluids , which are extricated from the muscular fibres of animals by putrefaction , consist of fixed and animal hepatic , mixed with a very small proportion of phlogisticated air * .
ro8506	smelled	the piece	little putrid					At the end of three days	in contact with the common air		Equal quantities of fresh veal , consisting of a mixture of muscular fibres and of fat , and weighing each one dram , were then exposed to these airs .	At the end of three days the piece that was in contact with the common air had not altered its colour or consistence , but smelled a little putrid .	The colour of the fatty parts of the piece that was exposed to the hepatic air was changed to a dark green , the muscular fibres were cracked and shrivelled on the surfaces as if they had been seared with a hot iron , and the whole had acquired a soft consistence .

Similar trials were made with two pieces of fresh veal , one of which was exposed over mercury to common air , and the other to air extricated from putrid veal by distillation .	The former in three days had not changed its appearance ; the latter had become green round the edges , and was interspersed with green spots .

The air at the last was very fetid ; it occasioned sioned a copious precipitate in lime - water ; it was highly inflammable , and burned with a blue lambent flame .	The piece , on the contrary , which was exposed to the common air , did not , as has been already observed , so soon lose its fibrous texture , nor so speedily acquire a dark colour , as that which was in contact with the animal air .
ro8506	odour	its	fetid|vitriolic						by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids		It advanced slowly , and at the expiration of six weeks a considerable part of the muscular fibres had run down to a brown liquid .	The air in which it was placed now occasioned a copious precipitation in limewater , and the brown liquid was found to be impregnated with animal hepatic and fixed air ; the existence of the latter being known by means of lime - water , and that of the former by its occasioning a dark precipitate in a solution of nitrated silver , as well as by its fetid odour , which was increased by the vitriolic , and destroyed by the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids .	The following experiment was made with a view to determine whether pure air accelerates the progress of putrefaction in animal substances .
ro8506	putrid|putrid	the beef	highly putrid|putrid					At the end of a week	exposed to the pure air		In the month of December , 1789 , equal portions of pure and of common air were introduced into two equal jars over mercury , in each of which was placed about two drams of fresh beef .	At the end of a week , the beef which was exposed to the pure air had become highly putrid ; but very little change was produced in that which was exposed to the common air .	The facts which have been ascertained by the preceding experiments , appear to lead to the following conclusions respecting the process of putrefaction in the lean of animal substances .
ro8506	odour	of animal hepatic air	fetid					for several weeks	by mixing it with pure air		By exposure to heat the fixed air of the animal fibre is extricated , hepatic air and volatile alkali are produced , and the inflammable principle not coming into contact with the pure air of the atmosphere , is raised in the form of heavy inflammable air .	I have found , that the fetid odour of animal hepatic air is destroyed by mixing it with pure air , and suffering it to remain in contact with that fluid for several weeks .	When it was placed in this situation , it acquired an odour which was not exactly similar to any that I had ever before perceived , but which bore some resemblance to that of inflammable air obtained by dissolving iron in spirit of vitriol .

When it was placed in this situation , it acquired an odour which was not exactly similar to any that I had ever before perceived , but which bore some resemblance to that of inflammable air obtained by dissolving iron in spirit of vitriol .	* It is scarcely necessary to observe , that the existence of fixed , inflammable , and phlogisticated air in animal substances , and the composition of volatile alkali , were discovered before I began to give particular attention to this subject .
ro8506	smell	of animal hepatic air	peculiar						by agitating it with vinegar|with the concentrated vitriolic acid		* It is scarcely necessary to observe , that the existence of fixed , inflammable , and phlogisticated air in animal substances , and the composition of volatile alkali , were discovered before I began to give particular attention to this subject .	The peculiar smell of animal hepatic air is likewise destroyed by agitating it with vinegar , or with the concentrated vitriolic acid .	But the fluids which most speedily produce this effect , are the concentrated nitrous and dephlogisticated marine acids ; and these fluids are known to abound with pure air .
ro8506	effluvia|putrid|putrid|putrid	of putrid|putrid|putrid animal substances	putrid|putrid|putrid						when they are exposed		The action of the hepatised ammonia likewise explains the reason why the probes are frequently corroded when they are introduced into sinuous ulcers , or applied to the surfaces of carious bones .	To the same cause it is probably owing , that polished metallic vessels are quickly tarnished , when they are exposed to the effluvia of putrid animal substances .	From the foregoing experiments it moreover appears , that animal hepatic air imparts to the fat of animals recently killed a green colour ; that it renders the muscular fibres soft and flaccid , and increases the tendency to putrefaction .
ro8506	smell	the hepatised ammonia	putrid				the cancerous matter				It is therefore a septic principle ; and hence it is extremely probable , that the compound of this fluid with volatile alkali , which is found in the matter discharged by the open cancer , produces deleterious effects : for although the mischief in cancerous ulcers seems principally to depend upon a morbid action of the vessels , whence the unhealthy state of the matter discharged by such ulcers is supposed to derive its origin , yet from the corrosion of the coats of the larger blood - vessels , and the obstructions in the contiguous glands , there can be little doubt that this matter aggravates the disease .	The experiments recited above appear to prove , that the hepatised ammonia is the ingredient which communicates to the cancerous matter its putrid smell , its greater thinness , and , in a word , all the peculiar properties by which it differs from healthy pus .	From these considerations it was inferred , that a medicine which would decompose the hepatised ammonia , and destroy the fetor of the animal hepatic air , without at the same time increasing the morbid action of the vessels , would be productive of salutary effects .

From these considerations it was inferred , that a medicine which would decompose the hepatised ammonia , and destroy the fetor of the animal hepatic air , without at the same time increasing the morbid action of the vessels , would be productive of salutary effects .	The nitrous acid does not destroy the fetor of hepatic air , unless it be highly concentrated ; and in this state it is well known that it speedily corrodes animal substances .

The nitrous acid does not destroy the fetor of hepatic air , unless it be highly concentrated ; and in this state it is well known that it speedily corrodes animal substances .	But the fetor of hepatic air quickly disappears when it is mixed with the dephlogisticated marine acid , even though the latter be so much diluted with water as to render it a very mild application .

But the fetor of hepatic air quickly disappears when it is mixed with the dephlogisticated marine acid , even though the latter be so much diluted with water as to render it a very mild application .	I have found that this acid , diluted with thrice its weight of water , gives but little pain when it is applied to ulcers that are not very irritable ; and in several cases of cancer it appeared to correct the fetor , and to produce a thicker and more healthy pus .

The dephlogisticated marine acid , as is generally known , has the power of destroying the colour , the smell , and perhaps the taste , of the greater part of animal and vegetable substances .	We have seen that it corrects the fetor of putrid flesh .

Before I was thus satisfied , I imagined this Accident to have proceeded rather from Lobel ' s Oenanthe ; thinking , that as that Plant grows near the Sides of Rivers , these Soldiers might have gathered it by the River Lee , which runs by the Town , and eaten it for Smallage , to which it has some Resemblance .

It is now known , that the Cicuta major , the Cicuta aquatica , and the Oenanthe of Lobel , are certain Poisons ; but there are two others of the same Class , growing common in England , and not much unlike these in Smell and other Circumstances , vehemently to be suspected : The one is the Cicutaria tenuifolia of Mr .

I tried the effects of a strong aqueous solution of opium upon the irritated parts of muscular fibres , but could not perceive an opiate manifestly to compose these spastic motions of the parts , as Haller alleges they do : though in some trials I fancied there were grounds for such a conclusion .	However this is no argument against the internal use of opiates , where the solids are greatly irritated .

The first five that I opened , had hearded with those that were Ill , and the Symptoms of this Distemper were just become visible ; in these , Gall - bladders were larger than usual , and filled with Bile of a natural Taste and Smell , but of a greener Colour .	Their Pancreas ' s were shrivelled , some of the Glands obstructed and tumified .

Their Gall - bladders were about three times their usual bigness , and filled with Bile of a natural Taste and Smell , but of a deep Green Colour .

In this Experiment ( especially if the Ingredients are made very high ) the Spirit of Nitre does as it were act the part of a Coal of fire : as fire exhales and drives up water that is thrown upon it , so does this spirit of Nitre very furiously throw up a great quantity of the Vinous spirit , in so much that it presently perfumes a Room with the smell : but to be more exact in this Observation , we mixed equal parts together in a Retort , and then cemented Receiver of good dimentions , and so we condensed that Vapor which rises from this mixture and obtained much of our Spirit of Wine again .	Both these Experiments may serve as Arguments against the notion of Acidum and Alkali , since mighty Conflicts may be excited by bodies of differing Textures where these two Principles are not conspicuous .

I satisfied myself during these researches , which have lasted more than twelve months , that no sulphuretted nor phosphuretted hydrogen was given off ; and my researches , as far as they have proceeded , tend to prove that the noxious vapours given off during putrefaction , contain the N , S , and Ph of the animal substance , and that these elements are not liberated in the simple form of ammonia , and sulphuretted and phosphuretted hydrogen .	I also remarked during this investigation , that , as putrefaction proceeds , different volatile bodies are given off .

Before concluding , I may add , that when the platinum salts are heated in small test - tubes , they give off vapours , some acid and some alkaline , possessing a most obnoxious and sickening odour , very like the odours of putrefaction ; and that at the same time a white crystalline sublimate , which is not chloride of ammoniium , is torrned .	As I foresee that these researches will occupy several years , I have deemed it my duty in the mean time to lay the above facts before the Society .

The lower boiling - point and overpowering odour of the trimethylphosphine , render it advisable to mix the materials with considerable quantities of alcohol or ether ; moreover , on account of the extreme oxidability of the phosphorus - compound , it is necessary to operate in vessels filled with carbonic acid and immediately sealed before the blowpipe .	After digestion for a short time at 100 ? , the mixture of the two liquids solidifies to a hard , dazzling white , crystalline mass , containing the two bromides , C5 H13 P Br2 = [ ( C2 H4 Br ) ( C H3 ) 3 P ] Br , and C8 H22 P2 Br2 [ ( C2 HJ4 ) ( C H 3 ) 3 Br , one or the other predominating , according to the proportions in which the two bodies were allowed to act upon one another .

Professor Owen determined the question by observing the phases of change relatively between the ovaries and the glands in question , and established their true mammary nature , by the dissection in 1831 of no less than five female Ornithorhynchi and one Echidna ; a doctrine , which was afterwards confirmed by observations made in Australia on the secretion itself of the gland .

In 1834 there appeared in the Philosophical Transactions Professor Owen ' s paper , describing impregnated specimens of Ornithorhynchus .

ro8658	smell	minute drops of a yellowish oil	perceptible								2 .	) On compressing the glands in a specimen in the Museum of the Zoological Society , where they had arrived at the maximum of development , there escaped from these orifices minute drops of a yellowish oil , which afforded neither perceptible taste nor smell , except such as was derived from the preserving liquor .	Having in vain attempted to insert the smallest absorbent pipe into these orifices , I thrust it into the extremity of a lobule , and after a few unsuccessful efforts at length perceived the mercury graduially diffusing itself in minute globules through the parenchyma of the lobule ; and at the distance of an 523 inch from the place of insertion it had evidently entered a central duct , down which it freely ran to the areola , where it escaped externally from one of the minute orifices just described .
ro8658	odorous|odorous	substance	odorous|odorous								Where the ovary had made a considerable advance towards perfection , the glands did not exhibit a corresponding degree of development ; they had only begun to enlarge and to manifest their obedience to the law of the sexual impulse .	But had their office been to secrete , as Professor GEOFFROY supposes , an odorous substance attractive of the male , their maximum of development ought to have been exhibited in this specimen , in which the uteri evinced , by their size and vascularity , traces of high excitement , and the ova appeared ripe for impregnation .	The greatest development of the abdominal glands , on the contrary , was observed where the ovary appeared to have recently executed its function .
ro8658	odoriferous|odoriferous	glands	odoriferous|odoriferous								It therefore comes to be considered whether their structure is so widely different from the ordinary mammary gland as it has been represented to be .	Now , whether the secretion of these glands be milk or not , it is highly probable , from its being conveyed externally by long and narrow ducts , that it is of a liquid nature ; and this mode of being carried off is much more analogous to that exhibited in the ordinary lacteal apparatus than in the odoriferous glands , which more commonly open externally by one large and wide orifice .	The excretory orifices of the glands in the Ornitliorhynchus , moreover , are not extended over a wide surface , but are collected into a point , in all probability , not disproportionate to the size of the mouth in the young animal , and these points are situated in parts of the body most convenient for the transmission of a lacteal secretion from the mother to her offspring .
ro8670	smell		volatile alkaline						by the addition of fixed alkali to the soluble part of the sublimate		This shows that none of the mercury unites with the acid of the sal ammoniac .	There was no volatile alkaline smell produced by the addition of fixed alkali to the soluble part of the sublimate , though there were an excess of it added ; which proves that the sal ammoniac was totally decomposed .	* The vapour , which arises in dissolving tin in the acid of salt , becomes inflammable , when the solution is made in large quantity , by means of heat ; the like happens also with regard to lead .

This mixture soon grows warm of it self after being put into the body , and produces a penetrating vinous smell , no ways like that which is afforded by dissolving tin in the acid of salt .	In this operation , part of the tin unites with the acid of salt , and is at last dissipated in the operation .

But the Experiment made on the supposed Bone ashes , by putting a small portion into the bowl of a clean Tobacco - pipe made glowing , it soon appeared to the contrary ; for the said matter immediately kindled dled into a bright flame , and sent forth a scent somewhat like that of hoofs or horns , tho it had a very fragrant smell before .

When the alkaline solution is first formed , by adding water to the dry alkaline mass in the crucible , a pungent and peculiar smell is immediately perceived .	This smell , as I afterwards discovered , arises from the extrication of a very volatile metallic oxide ; and , as this smell is one of its most distinguishing characters , I should on that account incline to call the metal Osmium .

This smell , as I afterwards discovered , arises from the extrication of a very volatile metallic oxide ; and , as this smell is one of its most distinguishing characters , I should on that account incline to call the metal Osmium .	This oxide may be expelled from the alkali by any acid , and obtained in solution with water by distillation .
ro8680	smell		strong	The solution							The sulphuric acid , being the least volatile , is the most proper for this purpose ; but as , even of this acid , a little is liable to pass over , a second slow distillation is required , to obtain the oxide perfectly free from it .

Heated in a similar situation with copper and with gold , it melted with each of these metals , forming alloys which were quite malleable .

ro8690	vapour	of the									I afterwards purposely induced a similar change in the blood within the vessels of an amputated limb by means of mustard * .	Having ascertained that the red corpuscles , though they had been long at rest , were perfectly free from the slightest tendency to aggregation , I suspended , at a little distance from the web , a piece of lint smeared with freshly prepared mustard , so that the pungent vapour of the volatile oil might play upon it ; and left ' it so for about a quarter of an hour , when I found the red discs aggregated , as usually seen in frog ' s blood outside the body .	I then shed some blood from the other leg between two plates of glass , and on carefully sketching and comparing the groups of corpuscles in this specimen and those within the vessels of the irritated webs , found that their characters were precisely similar * .
ro8690	odour		ammoniacal								Hence it is probable that , even if the blood were at rest in the vessels of a part , a stronger degree of irritation would be required in order to determine coagulation than would suffice to induce adhesiveness of the corpuscles , which seems to be a more sensitive test of a deviation of the tissues from the standard of health .	I have however ascertained , by experiments upon the amputated sheep ' s foot , that if caustic ammonia is applied freely to a part of a vein after pressing the blood out of it , and the blood allowed to return when the ammoniacal odour has passed off , coagulation takes place in the portion of the vessel which has been so treated , although the chemical action of ammonia , if any of it remained in the tissues , would tend to prevent or check coagulation * .	I have also found a similar local clot form , though more slowly , after merely pinching a piece of a vein .
ro8690	vapour		pungent								about midway between perfect concentration and full diffusion .	An assistant then held at a short distance above it a piece of lint soaked in the strongest liquor ammonihe , so that its pungent alkaline vapour might play upon the exposed area , while the rest of the foot was protected by the oil .	This having been continued for a few seconds , accumulation of corpuscles and stagnation occurred in the vessels of the area , without any change in the appearance of the pigment .
ro8690	vapour	of the volatile oil	pungent								Shortly after this had been done , I noticed that the pigment was in a state of full diffusion in a ring round about the opaque mass , producing the reticular appearance shown in the stripe down the middle of the sketch .	I had in a previous case seen a similar ring become affected with congestion , when a portion of mustard had been applied for a long time , in consequence of the pungent vapour of the volatile oil playing upon the neighbouring parts of the web , and there could be no doubt that the effect on the pigment in the present instance was due to the same cause ; but in the latter no material change was as yet visible in the blood except close to the edge of the mustard , where the corpuscles were seen to be abnormally adhesive .	After the lapse of about ' an hour , the area on which the irritant had lain being examined , was found to be the seat of the most intense inflammatory congestion , indicated in the drawing by the crimson colour ' of the vessels , but the pigment there had experienced only an exceedingly slight degree of diffusion , being , in fact , almost exactly in the same state as at the commencement of the experiment .
ro8690	vapour	of the volatile oil									After the lapse of about ' an hour , the area on which the irritant had lain being examined , was found to be the seat of the most intense inflammatory congestion , indicated in the drawing by the crimson colour ' of the vessels , but the pigment there had experienced only an exceedingly slight degree of diffusion , being , in fact , almost exactly in the same state as at the commencement of the experiment .	Thus the vapour of the volatile oil , though operating too mildly to cause inflammatory congestion , nevertheless induced the highest possible degree of pigmentary diffusion ; but the mustard , where it lay actually in contact with the web , and acted energetically upon it , arrested that very process of diffusion to which its gentler operation gives rise .	In the progress of the case it happened that the animal changed from the medium tint which it had at first to a very pale colour , the pigment , in the web generally , assuming the dotted condition depicted on the right - hand side of the drawing .
ro8700	smell	of ammonia									Having squeezed the blood out of a limited portion of one of the veins of a sheep ' s foot , and prevented its return by appropriate means , I treated the empty portion with caustic ammonia , the neighbouring parts of the vein being , protected from the irritating vapour by lint steeped in olive oil .	After the smell of ammonia had passed off , I let the blood flow back again and left it undisturbed for a while , when I found on examination a cylindrieal clot in the part that had been treated with ammoniia , while in the adjacent parts of the same vessel the blood remained fluid .	I repeated this experiment several times and always with the same result .

The smell in burning was very unlike that of asphaltus ; nor did it resemble that of the common pitch of the fir - tree : being rather aromatic .	It was compared with a variety of resins and gum resins ; but seemed not to resemble any of them , excepting myrrh ; and that but very slightly .

ro8709	smell	of that fluid		through it			I				As various persons may , perhaps , be induced by this paper to repeat such experiments , and as ether is a fluid which can with difficulty be preserved , it may be useful to mention , that a cork confines ether in a glass bottle much better than a glass stopple , which it is almost impossible to grind so well as entirely to prevent the evaporation of ether .	When a stopple , made very nicely out of a uniform and close piece of cork , which goes rather tight , is put upon a bottle of ether , the smell of that fluid cannot be perceived through it ; but I never saw a glass stopple that could produce the same effect .	By opening ing the bottle very often , or by long keeping , the cork becomes loose , in which case it must be changed ; and thus ether , spirit of wine , or any fluid , excepting those which corrode cork , may be preserved .

Lastly , Consid ring the Egyptian way of Embalming by rolling , and the Modern by wrapping up in Searcloath , obscure the Object , and are also imperfect upon several other accounts , the Author endeavours to show a possibility of inventing a method how to preserve the whole Compages of the Body for ever without Putrefaction , in such manner as its Texture and Structure may remain entire , of the same proportion as before , and of the same Colour and Flexibility , without any visible contraction , diminution or unconformity of Parts , whereby the DeadCorps may be kept by the Parents , or handled by the Anatomist without any offensive Smell , or fastidious Mador .

Being wearied with so many Remedies , she went in her Coach to take the Air at Vincennes ; after her return she had an Inclination to go to Stool , and filled a Bason with gross Excrements , a little the black , and not very stinking , this she did a second time ; and the Lady found her self immediately relieved , her swelling disappeared , her Urine stopped ; and to conclude , in a few Hours she was perfectly well .	A Year after that , she fell into an Apoplexy , out of which she Recovered by Emetiques and Purgations , nothing as yet did appear in the lower Region of her Belly ; but in 1691 .

Before I cut it , I followed the Intestines , and remarked that the Ileon did lye along the Tumor being flat against it , and returned to join the Colon as is usual ; so the Excrements had the liberty to pass from the Ileon to the Colon , without entring into the Tumor , which after this I opened ; I found about Three Chopins ( or Quarts ) of greyish Matter , without smell , and of a Consistence rather liquid then thick ; after that I searched for a Com ~ munication it might have with the Guts , but discovered neither hole , nor any appearance it might have ; the interior membranes were very beautiful , and all the parts of the Swelling , as well as of the neighbouring Organs , appeared very sound .	Though I perceived no Communication this Tumor had with the Ileon , yet some must have been in the beginning of this Tumor , by which it discharged its gross Excrements ; but after this Evacuation I believe that this opening was stopped , and that the sides of this great bag , which had come close together , by the going out of this gross Matter , did by degrees stretch and open themselves to receive this Heterogeneous Stuff , which I found there , produced either by the Glands of these parts , or some lymphatick Vessels which I saw there , or some Fluid Bodies expressed from the Chyle or other Humors .

At Paris I examined the air of different places at the same time , and especially of those situations where it was most probable to meet with infected air , because those places abounded with putrid substances and impure exhalations ; but the differences I observed were very small , and much less than what could have been suspected , for they hardly arrived to one fiftieth of the air in the tube .	Having taken the air of the hill called Mont Valerien at the height of about 500 feet above the level of Paris , and compared it with the air of Paris taken at the same time and treated alike ; I found the former to be hardly one thirtieth better than the latter .

ro8782	fumes|fumes|smell		white|orange|very peculiar|not a disagreeable								GAY LUSsAC , namely , that a peculiar acid , which he has called chloric acid , may be procured from the hyperoxymuriate of baryta by sulphuric acid , led me to examine the action of acids on the hyperoxymuriates under new circumstances , and I have made some observations which appear to me not unworthy of being communicated to the Royal Society .	If so or 40 parts of sulphuric acid be poured upon one part of dry hyperoxymuriate of potassa in a wine glass , and the salt be agitated in the acid , there is a very slight effervescence only , the acid becomes of a deep orange tint , and white fumes , mixed with orange fumes , fill the upper part - of the glass , which have a very peculiar and not a disagreeable smell .	The slight effervescence taking place in this process , induced me to suppose that the substance which coloured the acid must contain a larger proportion of oxygene than euchlorine , for I have shown , in a work published in 181i , * that hyperoxymuriate of potassa contains six proportions of oxygene ; and by its decomposition 2 .

Although the peculiar character of this variety of pitchstone is its smell , yet , I believe , it differs from all others , including those from Arran , in the degree in which it is disposed to divide into thin lamine ; its proneness to disintegrate , and the regularity of its rhomboidal fragments .	So much is it inclined to disintegrate , that a piece , nearly compact , after lying for some days on the table of a warm laboratory , fell into large rhomboidal fragments .

The circumstances above detailed namely , the oily smell , the disintegration , and the effect of ignition , excited a suspicion that the mineral contained some inflammable substance .	One hundred grains of the compact , in fine powder , were exposed to a white heat in a platina crucible , and were converted into a glass of a very pale leek - green colour , and lost ten per cent .

"On examining the fused retort , it appeared that , for the distance of an inch from the bottom , the colour of the stone had become , as in former experiments , of an ash - grey , and still "" resembling pumice , but that the upper part was brown , as in experiment 3 ; so that it seemed as if the bitumen had risen from the more strongly heated part of the retort , and having been stopped in its progress by the fusing of the neck , had given to the upper part of the mass the same brown colour which I had observed when the whole stone had been originally ignited in an open crucible , as mentioned in the beginning of this paper ."

Crystals , not dried with sufficient care , when kept in corked tubes , were changed after a few months into a yellowish white semifluid mass , of peculiar odour , which , by recrystallization from boiling water , furnished a considerable quantity of pure sulphide of triethylphosphine .	To establish this transformation by numbers , the purified crystals were identified by analysis .

Oxide of stanethylium presents the appearance of a somewhat cream - white amorphous powder , closely resembling peroxide of tin , but less heavy than that oxide ; it has a peculiar though slight ethereal odour and a bitter taste ; it is insoluble in water , alcohol and ether , but readily dissolves in solutions of acids and of the fixed alkalies ; with acids it forms salts , which are , however for the most part difficultly crystallizable ; those with strong acids exhibit an acid reaction .	The nitrate deflagrates when heated to about 1200 C .

Sulphide of stanethylium presents the appearance of an amorphous cream - coloured powder , having a pungent and very nauseous smell , resembling decayed horse - radish : when heated it fuses , froths up and decomposes , emitting vapours of a most insupportable odour .	Heated with nitric acid it is decomposed with the formation of peroxide of tin .

This salt is best prepared by dissolving oxide of stanethyliumn in dilute hydrochloric acid : on evaporation at a gentle heat or over sulphuric acid in vacuo , the chloride crystallizes out in long colourless needles , isomorphous with the iodide , which salt it also closely resembles in all its properties ; it is however more volatile , and therefore emits a more intensely pungent and irritating odour than the iodide .	Stanethylium .

Stanethylium exists at the ordinary atmospheric temperature , as a thick heavy , oily liquid , of a yellow or brownish - yellow colour , and an exceedingly pungent odour , resembling that of its compounds , but much more powerful .	It is insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol and ether .
ro8808	odour		peculiar								At about 150 ? C .	it enters into ebullition , a quantity of metallic tin is deposited , and a colourless liquid distils over , having a peculiar odour , containing a considerable quantity of tin , and exhibiting no tendency to combine with iodine or bromine : the composition and properties of this liquid I have not further ascertained ; it possibly consists of or contains binethide of tin ( Sn ( C4 H5 ) 2 ) .	In contact with the air stanethylium rapidly attracts oxygen and is converted into a white powder , which has all the properties of oxide of stanethylium .
ro8808	odour		most insupportable|very peculiar						before contact with water		Zinemethyliurn .	From a preliminary experiment , it was ascertained that the gas evolved on opening the decomposition tube possessed , before contact with water , a most insupportable and very peculiar odour , and that , when ignited or brought in contact with pure oxygen gas , it burnt with a greenish blue flatme , producing dense white fumnes : when a porcelain plate was held in this flame , it immediately became coated with a jet black deposit , surrounded by a white ring ; this black deposit dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid with evolution of hydrogen gas , and the solution was found to contain chloride of zinc .	Hence it was evident that a volatile or gaseous compound of zinc was present amongst the products of decomposition , and this was soon found to reside in the mobile liquid above mentioned ; for on inverting the tube and allowing a few drops of the liquid to escape , it inflamed spontaneously the instant it came in contact with the air , and produced , by its combustion , large quantities of oxide of zinc .

Zinemethylium combines directly with oxygen , chlorine , iodine , & amp ; c .
ro8808	odour	it	peculiar penetrating								Zincethylium .	This body is formed under precisely the same circumstances as zincmethylium , iodide of ethyl being substituted for iodide of methyl ; it is a colourless and transparent liquid , refracting light strongly , and having a peculiar penetrating odour ; it is less volatile than zincmethylium , and is not so readily prepared pure , owing to its retention of a small quantity of ethyl gas in solution ; its affinities are also somewhat weaker than zincmethyliumn , and it only takes fire in air spontaneously when exposed in considerable quantity .	When allowed to absorb oxygen slowly , it forms a white amorphous oxide ; it combines also directly with iodine , chlorine and bromine .

C	at ordinary temperatures	which	Iodide of hydrargyromethylium is a white solid , crystallizing in minute nacreous scales , which are insoluble in water , moderately soluble in alcohol , and very soluble in ether and iodide of methyl ; by the spontaneous evaporation of these solutions the crystals are again deposited unchanged .	Iodide of hydrargyromethylium is slightly volatile at ordinary temperatures , and exhales a weak but peculiarly unpleasant odour , which leaves a nauseous taste upon the palate for several days ; at 100 ? C .	the volatility is much greater , and the crystals are rapidly dissipated at this temperature when exposed to a current of air .
ro8808	odour		peculiar|most insupportable								condensing in brilliant and extremely thin crystalline plates .	In contact with the fixed alkalies and ammonia , it is converted into oxide of hydrargyromethylium , which is dissolved by excess of all these reagents ; from these solutions sulphide of amnmonium throws down sulphide of hydrargyromethylium as a slightly yellow flocculent precipitate of a peculiar and most insupportable odour .	I have not yet further examined the reactions of this remarkable body , nor have I attempted the isolation .

ro8826	Effluvia|Smell	of the Sulphur	sulphureous						When Brimstone Matches are burning|upon such an Occasion		We are taught by Chemistry , to mix Fluids together , which immediately coalesce into a Solid .	When Brimstone Matches are burning , the Effluvia of the Sulphur repel each other to great Distances , as may be known by the sulphureous Smell upon such an Occasion .	Now , though these Particles repel each other , they attract the Air very strongly , as appears by the following Experiment : Take a tall Glass Receiver closed at Top , holding about four Quarts of Air , and having put its open End over a Bundle of Brimstone Matches on Fire , standing up in the Middle of a large Dish with Water in it , ( to keep the Air from coming in at the Bottom of the said Receiver ) you will observe , that not only as soon as the Matches are burnt out , but a good while before , the Air , instead of being expanded by the Flame of the Brimstone , will retire into less Compass , the Water beginning to rise from the Dish up into the Receiver , and continuing so to do till some time after the Matches are burnt out ; so that there will be in the Receiver only three Quarts of Air , instead of four ( more or less , in proZ 2 portion portion to the Quantity of Brimstone burnt ) : And this plainly happens by some of the Effluvia , or little Parts of the Sulphur , attracting some of the Particles of the Air , so as to make an unelastic Compound , that precipitates into the Water .

Now , though these Particles repel each other , they attract the Air very strongly , as appears by the following Experiment : Take a tall Glass Receiver closed at Top , holding about four Quarts of Air , and having put its open End over a Bundle of Brimstone Matches on Fire , standing up in the Middle of a large Dish with Water in it , ( to keep the Air from coming in at the Bottom of the said Receiver ) you will observe , that not only as soon as the Matches are burnt out , but a good while before , the Air , instead of being expanded by the Flame of the Brimstone , will retire into less Compass , the Water beginning to rise from the Dish up into the Receiver , and continuing so to do till some time after the Matches are burnt out ; so that there will be in the Receiver only three Quarts of Air , instead of four ( more or less , in proZ 2 portion portion to the Quantity of Brimstone burnt ) : And this plainly happens by some of the Effluvia , or little Parts of the Sulphur , attracting some of the Particles of the Air , so as to make an unelastic Compound , that precipitates into the Water .	If the Elasticity of the Air is quite lost when the Repulsion of its Particles is taken off , or sufficiently counteracted , it must follow , that its Elasticity depends upon Repulsion : And that this is often the Case , appears by a great Number of Dr .
ro8826	Smell		sulphureous								Now the Air had been confined in that Bone , together with many sulphureous Particles , in such manner , that the mutual Attraction of the Sulphur and the Air had alternately destroyed each other ' s repulsive Force , and brought those Substances into a little Compass ; but the Fire in the Distillation separated them from each other , so as to restore them , in a great measure , to their usual Elasticity .	This appeared by bringing a Candle near the Mouth of the Bottle that held this revived Air ; for every time the Candle was brought near , the Air took Fire , and flashed out of the Bottle with a sulphureous Smell .	The Air may be consolidated in many hard Bodies , so as to be there quite void of Elasticity , and there do the Office of a Cement , till by the Action of Fire , or some particular Fermentations , it is again restored to its perfectly elastic State .

So long as the ebullition continued , no ozone made its appearance ; but on allowing the liquid gradually to cool , without arresting the current , its presence soon became manifest from its odour and action on iodide of potassium paper .	The ebullition and the current of the mixed gases must have rendered the presence of nitrogen here impossible .

On passing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen into a solution of azobenzol in alcoholic ammonia , the yellowish - red liquid is rapidly decolorized , and yields on addition of water a crystalline precipitate of a peculiar camphor - like smell .	This substance contains a minute quantity of the sulphur which separates , the bulk of which , however , remains dissolved as polysulphide of ammonium ; it is easily purified by two or three crystallizations from very dilute alcohol .

The Surgeons who constantly dressed the Patient before the Operation , did observe then , as they have since , that the Humour discharged formerly at the Fistula , had frequently the Appearance , and , as they thought , the Smell of Excrements , so that there is no Doubt that the Cause of it was the Wound made in the Gut , by the Pin giving way occasionally to such a Discharge .

When the powder was mixed with quicklime , and the mixture heated in a small retort , it was decomposed with a few slight cracks ; a little fluid condensed in the neck of the retort ; it had the smell of ammonia , and instantly rendered turmeric paper brown ; a little gas also came over , having the properties of nitrogene .	The presence of moisture appeared to be necessary in the foregoing experiment to develope the ammonia ; for when the powder was mixed with quicklime , previously heated to redness , the slight explosions arising from its decomposition were more numerous , and the odour of ammonia could not be perceived .

The presence of ammllonia was not only indicated by the odour , but by the instant production of white fumes when muriatic acid was brought near the mixture ; and turmeric paper was immnediately changed to brown by the amnmonia disengaged .

It was however very remarkable how exactly this degree of Heat was determined by the expansion of the Spirit , for in the instant it reached a certain Mark on the Neck , it began to emit its Bubbles : and having been taken out a little to cool and subside , it would certainly and constantly fall a bubling again , when upon a second Immersion , it was arrived at the aforesaid Mark : During this Experiment , it appeared both by the Dew on the Neck , and by the Scent in the Room , that tho ' the Neck were about 30 Inches long , yet the Spirit did evaporate very fast for the smallness of the Surface of the Liquor And I have often noted the like Evaporations condensed in Dew within the Head of the ordinary sealed Thermometers , in very hot Weather .	This degree of Heat which made Spirit of Wine begin to boil , being determined so nicely as I have said , made me conclude , that this might very properly be taken for the Limit of the Scale of Heat in a Thermometer ; and the effect thereof in the expansion of any other Fluid being accurately noted , might be easily transferred to any sort of Thermometer whatsoever .

The reticular structure bears a decided resemblance to the epithelium of the olfactory mucous membrane , and still more to what I have elsewhere described as the fourth layer of the olfactory bulb in the Sheep , and particularly in the Cat .	In the pons Varolii the decussation between fibres from the opposite sides is extremely complicated .
ro8965	effluvia|smells										This consideration , as has been observed , must alter the form of our proposed inquiry ; for the question being thus at least partly decided , since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which give no light , it can only become a subject of inquiry , whether some of these heat - making rays may not have a power of rendering objects visible , superadded to their now already established power of heating bodies .	This being the case , it is evident that the onus probandi ought to lie with those who are willing to establish such an hypothesis ; for it does not appear that nature is in the habit of using one and the same mechanism with any two of our senses ; witness the vibrations of air that make sound ; the effluvia that occasion smells ; the particles that produce taste ; the resistance or repulsive powuers that affect the touch : all these are evadently suited to their respective organs of sense .	Are we then here , on the contrary , to suppose that the same mechanism should be the cause of such different sensations , as the delicate perceptions of vision , and the very grossest of all affections , which are common to the coarsest parts of our bodies , when exposed to heat ? But , let us see what light may now be obtained from the several articles that have been discussed in this Paper .

The particles of odoriferous bodies seem to be strongly attracted by the air , as they are so readily dispersed through it , and camphor , which is a light volatile body , may be entirely dissolved in the air , without leaving any remainder .	The air abounds with vitriolic and other acids , as is plain from the rusting of iron exposed to it .

From the Belly issued 14 Pints of a greenish Serum , mixed with a very purulent Matter , not a little fetid .

It produces no effect on the smell when breathed upon , has no taste , does not become electrical or phosphorescent byheat or friction , and does not adhere to the tongue till after it has been strongly ignited .	It does not decrepitate before the flame of the blow - pipe ; but it loses its hardness , and becomes quite opaque .

When it was acted on by a heat of from 212 ' to 6oo0 FAHRENHEIT in a glass tube , it gave out an elastic vapour , which when condensed appeared as a clear fluid possessing a slight empyreumatic smell , but no taste different from that of pure water .	The solution of the fossil in sulphuric acid , when evaporated sufficiently , deposited crystals which appeared in thin plates , and had all the properties of sulphate of alumine ; and the solid matter , when redissolved and mixed with a little carbonate of potash , slowly deposited octahedral crystals of alum .

It produced no cloudiness in solutions of muriate of barytes , of acetite of lead , of nitrate of silver , or of sulphate of iron .

That putting four or five Gallons of it into a half Tub , as they call it , of Wood , and straining a Canvas over it , to keep out Dust and Insects , and letting it stand in some shady room for three weeks or a month , it did of it self putrefy and stink exceedingly , and let fall to the bottom a black sediment like Mud .	That , coming often to see , what Alterations appeared in the putrefaction , He observed , that at the beginning , within twenty four hours , a slimy film floated on the top of the water , which after a while falling to the bottom , there came another such film in its place .

Hatchett found , that by treating dragon ' s blood with nitric acid , a feather - like sublimate was produced , which had the aspect , odour , and properties of benzoic acid , although no vestige of this acid could be obtained by simply exposing the dragon ' s blood to heat .	Guaiacum , although similar in its general character to resins , when treated as above , yielded only slight vestiges of the tanning product , but , like the gums , afforded a large quantity of oxalic acid .

The ground opened near the qualloe ( 6 ) at Bencoolen , and up the River in several places ; and there issued therefrom sulphureous earth , and large quantities of water , sending forth a most intolerable stench .	Poblo Point ( 7 ) was much cracked at the same time ; and some doosoons ( 8 ) in - land at Manna were destroyed , and many people in them .

ro9063	Smell	of the Kiln			resemble that of the Subterraneal fire						The other Springs , most of which are dry this year , are of ordinary use , containing no Mineral Salts in them : But I hope you will cease to wonder , that Coal should produce a volatile Salt by the action of fire , seeing I have gathered Sal armoniac from a burning Brick - kiln , where nothing but Clay and Coal is burnt together , and I hope none will expect the volatile Salt in the Sal armoniac from ordinary Clay .	The reason , that first prompted me to seek this Salt there , was , that the Smell of the Kiln did somewhat resemble that of the Subterraneal fire .	There is also a sort of Mineral we call a Slate , which is partly Coal , partly Alumstone , partly Marcasite , which being laid up in heaps and burnt , are used for hardening the Coal - ways ; upon these heaps , whilst burning , I have often gathered both Brimstone and Sal armoniac .

In water this wax is wholly insoluble ; but by boiling some hours , it communicates a brownish hue to the water , and its peculiar smell .	Alcohol also has no effect on it when cold .
ro9077	Alcohol								when cold		In water this wax is wholly insoluble ; but by boiling some hours , it communicates a brownish hue to the water , and its peculiar smell .	Alcohol also has no effect on it when cold .	Nevertheless , by the assistance of heat , two fluid ounces dissolve ten grains ; but eight of ' these are deposited again as the solution becomes cool , and the remainder may be precipitated by addition of water .
ro9077	odour		unpleasant								With respect to its combustion in the form of canldles , the author ' s trials have been very satisfactory .	When the wick is duly proportioned , the combustion is as perfect and uniform as that of any other wax ; and when about one sixth or one tenth of tallow is added to it , the brittleness which this wax has in its natural state is removed , without communicating to it any unpleasant odour , or impairing the brilliancy of the flame .	Two Drachms of White Hellebore [ Helleborus albus ] very much disordered him , and caused Reachings , Suffocations , Vomiting , and Voiding of Excrements .

At last he took two Drachms of Opium , which cast him into a deep sleep ; but after Vomiting and voiding fetid Excrements , he recovered by degrees his former briskness .	So many , and those so notorious Poisons , could not kill this Dog .

Next Day when we viewed the Place where he lay , we found a great quantity of fetid Excrements , like corrupted Blood , or the diluted Opium that he had taken : But still his Drowsiness continued , and tho ' we beat him with Whips , that he ran crying about the Room , yet he presently forgot it , and immediately fell asleep again .	In this sleepy Condition he continued 3 Days , refusing whatsoever was offered him to eat , or rather not minding that or any thing else .

In a Castrated Dog we observed the Processes of the Peritaneum and Spermatic Vessels to be covered with Fat , and scarce to be seen ; and that he did not smell so rank and strong , as other Dogs that had not been Castrated .	A yellow - streak ' d Lizard [ Lacerta Chalcidica ] which had been kept all the Winter in a Glass with Bran , being exposed to the Sun to refresh it , on the contrary died in a few Hours .
ro9085	Smell	some Pieces	stronger|more nauseous								Pots ' s Cases induced me to obtain the Favour of two or 3 Druggists to look over some Gentian - Root , one Parcel of which had no less than a 20th Part of a Root , which at first Sight was discovered to be no Gentian .	This Root , for which we have yet no Name , is of a greyish brown Colour externally , but it is browner , and more resinous internally : Most of that which I have seen , is about the Thickness of a Finger ; tho ' some is much larger and whiter ; which is a Reason with several for thinking there are two Sorts of it ; and indeed some Pieces emit a stronger and more nauseous Smell : But this I apprehend may be occasioned only by a larger Quantity of Resin in them .	All of them are of an acrid pungent Taste , and leave a Dryness on the Tongue .
ro9092	smell	oxide of	somewhat		like camphor						Davy , is its action upon oil of turpentine , which in one experiment was so violent as to occasion inflammation .	In other instances oxide of tin seemed to be formed , and a tenacious oil , having a smell somewhat like camphor .	Beside these compounds of tin with chlorine alone , there is also a submuriate observed by Proust , containing about 70A4 grey oxide , 19 muriatic acid , and 10 - 6 water .
ro9102	odour	of ozone	characteristic								To diminish the resistance of the acidulated water to the passage of the current , I placed in one vessel a pair of very large platinum plates , between which the current from a battery of ten of GRov , ' s cells was transmitted .	The oxygen bubbles liberated on so large a surface were extremely minute , and the gas thus generated , on being sent through iodide of potassium , scarcely coloured the liquid ; the characteristic odour of ozone was also almost entirely absent .	In the second vessel smaller plates were used .
ro9102	odour|fumes	of sulphurous acid	unmistakeable								It may , I think , be explained in the following manner : - To open the valve of the piston , the gas beneath it must have a certain tension , and the compression necessary to produce this appears sufficient to cause the combination of the constituents of the bisulphide of carbon with the oxygen of the air .	Such a combination certainly takes place , for the odour of sulphurous acid is unmistakeable amid the fumes .	To test this idea I tried the effect of compression in the air - syringe .
ro9102	fumes|fumes			fumes|fumes with a glass tube							A bit of tow or cotton wool moistened with bisulphide of carbon , and placed in the syringe , emitted a bright flash when the air was compressed .	By blowing out the fumes with a glass tube , this experiment may be repeated twenty times with the same bit of cotton .	When the substance is in excess , an easily fusible and volatile compound of a red colour is obtained ; when the phosphorus is in excess , the greater part of the product is more fixed .

It has a smell very similar to that of the solid compound of chlorine and phosphorus , which itself is very analogous to that of muriatic acid .

It has a smell very similar to that of the solid compound of chlorine and phosphorus , which itself is very analogous to that of muriatic acid .	It is rapidly absorbed by water .
ro9109	smell	of hydrogen							by sulphuric acid		It is rapidly absorbed by water .	When made to act upon ammonia , it forms with it a dense white salt , which , when acted upon by sulphuric acid , affords the peculiar substance , and at the same time a smell of hydrogen is perceived .	When mercury is heated in the acid gas , the same compound as that 79 produced by the action of the new substance directly upon mercury is formed , and hydrogen equal to half the volume of the gas is disengaged .
ro9109	smell	of nitrous gas							When nitric acid is applied to the double compound		When concentrated nitric acid is made to act on the triple compound , similar phenomena occur , and the substance reappears with effervescence .	When nitric acid is applied to the double compound , there is a smell of nitrous gas , and the substance is instantly reproduced .	With concentrated muriatic acid , the phenomena presented by the two different alkaline compounds , the binary and the triple , are very interesting .

If the yelks of the eggs were broken , so as to be mingled with the albumen ; if their whole substance were decomposed , so as to emit a more or less putrid odour ; if a powerful electric shock had been passed through them , in all these conditions , they fioze more quickly than fresh and uninjured eggs did , that were exposed with them to the same low temperature .	The average difference in the respective times of freezing was nearly the same as that already stated .

From my Childhood , till within about Twelve Years past , I used , almost constantly , upon taking Cold , to be seized immediately with an Inflammation in the Throat , attended with great Swelling , Throbbing and Soreness : And notwithstanding Bleeding and Purging , together with the Assistance of Gargles , Linctus ' s , and all the other Methods generally made use of in such Cases , it most commonly would take its Course ; that is , in about a Week or Ten Days time , it would suppurate and break , a considerable Quantity of fetid Matter would be discharged , and then I soon recovered .	- During its Continuance , I was unable to swallow any thing but warm Liquids , and even those not without much Difficulty and Pain ; but upon its breaking I found immediate Ease .

In about an Hour ' s time , as I sat by the Fire - side , I perceived a sort of disagreeable putrid Smell , which I did not mind at first , supposing it something accidental : But , finding a Continuance or rather an Increase of it , I began to examine what it might be owing to ; and was convinced , after I had changed my Place , that it proceeded from myself , and was really the Smell of my own Perspiration , which I found so much increased , as to become almost a Sweat .	At the same time , fancying my Throat a little easier , I took some more of the Jelly .
ro9111	Smell		same unpleasant putrid					after			At Supper I with some Difficulty got down a little Gruel ; and when I went to - bed , drank some Linseed - tea , sweetened with Syrup of Mulberries .	I soon got to sleep ; but , waking after some Hours , found myself in a gentle breathing Sweat , attended with the same unpleasant putrid Smell .	The Swelling in my Throat was , however , sensibly diminished , and the Soreness much abated : At which being rejoiced , I took a Mouthful of the Jelly that stood by my Bedside , and composed myself to sleep again .
ro9111	Smell		greatly offensive				to me		whenever I put my Nose into the Bed		A gentle Sweat continued during the whole Night ; and , in the Morning , the Swelling , to my great Amazement , was quite reduced , and the Soreness so inconsiderable , that about Ten o ' Clock I eat some Toast with Chocolate , and by Dinner - time had no more Remains of any Disorder than if it had never been .	I am very certain the Swelling was not discharged by breaking ; for had it broke , even in my Sleep , I must have found some ill Taste in my Mouth at waking : Whereas I was not sensible of any disagreeable Taste at all , but the Smell before - mentioned was greatly offensive to me , whenever I put my Nose into the Bed .	During the whole Time I have been speaking of , that is , for about Seventeen Hours , I made Water but once only , and then in a small Quantity : The Colour of it was very high , and it soon threw down an exceeding thick Sediment , as did all I made for Two Days afterwards , though gradually clearing up more and more .

ro9141	snuff						he				It was observed that , in smiling and laughing , his mouth was drawn in a very remarkable manner to the opposite side .	The attempt to whistle was attended with a ludicrous distortion of the lips ; when he took snuff and sneezed , the side where the suppuration had affected the nerve remained placid , while the opposite side exhibited the usual distortion .	Thus , it appears , that whenever the action of any of the muscles of the face is associated with the act of breathing , it is performed through the operation of this nerve .

ro9148	smell	they	strong vitriolic sulphureous						when a number of them were rubbed together between the palms of the hands		All the other species of ants in Grenada have a bitter musky taste .	These , on the contrary , are acid in the highest degree , and , when a number of them were rubbed together between the palms of the hands , they emitted a strong vitriolic sulphureous smell ; so much so , that , when this experiment was made , a gentleman conceived , that it might be owing to this quality that these insects were so unfriendly to vegetation .	This criterion to distinguish them was infallible , and known to every one .

At the same instant there issued out of this phial a yellowish vapour , of a very penetrating smell , which was soon followed by the extract itself , that spread itself all over the rim of the neck of the bottle .	I was so stupefied at this unexpected accident , that I imagined ( as it was very possible ) that the bottle was broken in pieces : and as soon as I saw my hands , arms , and breast , coloured in several places by the poison , which had besprinkled them in the explosion , I looked on myself as a dead man : which must certainly have been the case , if the bottle had burst , and the pieces of glass had scratched or cut me .

I made this preliminary preparation in a small closet , in which a young lad was actually at work ; and I did not think of making him quit it , because I did not imagine , that the poison , of which I intended to make trial , could produce any bad effects , without being introduced into the blood , by the opening of a wound .

Fourth , gravel containing water ; this stratum varies from two to ten feet in thickness , and is always the deepest in the places covered by peat ; in these places the lower part of the stratum becomes an heterogeneous mass of clay , sand , and gravel , and frequently exhales a disagreeable muddy smell .	Fifth , the main stratum of blue clay , which lies under this , extends under London and its vicinity , the average depth of this clay has been ascertained , by wells that have been dug through it , to be about two hundred feet under the surface of the more level lands , and proportionably deeper under the hills , as appears from Lord SPENCER ' S well at Wimbledon , which is five hundred and sixty - seven feet deep .

After the formation of the scum mentioned above , the next change that I observed was its separation into large masses or flakes ; to these , as well as to the scum itself , a number of minute air bubbles were attached , to which , no doubt , they owed their buoyancy ; after some time the masses again subsided , leaving the fluid almost totally free from any visible extraneous matter .

It was now perfectly transparent , and without taste or odour , but still retaining a slight brown tinge .	It sparkled when agitated or poured from one vessel to another , and by boiling a quantity of gas was disengaged from it : at the same time a thin film of carbonate of limne formed on the surface , which gradually subsided : 10 , 000 grains left by evaporation a saline crust , of a light brown colour , which , after being thoroughly dried , weighed 7 .

No smell of sulphurous acid was produced during the operation , nor did any charring of the contents of the retort occur ; when precipitated by acetate of lead , 1480 ' grains of sulphate of lead were obtained .	This is very little short of the 1500 given - by the acid when unacted upon by alcohol , and shows that nearly the whole of the sulphovinic acid had beenchanged back into the state of sulphuric acid ; and is completely at variance with the opinion , that when sulphuric acid and alcohol act upon each other , hypo - sulphuric acid is formed .
ro9193	smell	of sulphurous acid									The experiment therefore may be considered as the distillation of sulphovinic acid mixed with sulphate of potash , which it may be presumed remained inert during the process , and also with the water of the acid and of the salt .	The proportion of water , Fit is found , has an important influence ; but in the present experiment about a drachm of fluid distilled over , and left a blackened and acid salt in the retort , having the smell of sulphurous acid .	A few grains of carbonate of potash being added to the distilled product , abstracted a little water : the clear decanted liquor was then mixed with a little dry muriate of lime , and by agitation separated into two portions ; the upper one being decanted , amounted to nearly half a drachm , and was found to be pure ether .

The distilled product had no smell of ether , nor could any be discovered in it .	About nine fluid drachms were obtained ; to these , carbonate of potash was added , which separated the water , and left three drachms of a supernatant liquid , appearing by taste , smell and flame , to be alcohol : this was decanted , and poured upon muriate of lime ; no ether separated , but the whole formed one solution ; being distilled from the muriate it was evidently alcohol ; and being mixed with its weight of sulphuric acid , gave sulphuric ether or sulphovinic acid again .

TIhe precipitate by carbonate of ammonia , when exposed to a heat sufficient to boil water , in a retort having a receiver attached to it , gave out carbonate of ammonia , ( which was condensed in small crystals in the neck of the retort , ) and a yellowish fluid , which had the strong smell and taste of this volatile salt .	After the process of distillation , the solid matter remaining was found of a dark brown colour ; a part of it readily dissolved in cold water , and the solution acted on gelatine .

This Tree is very young , and did never yet bear any Fruit , perhaps , because it may be ( in a manner ) choked up , and that there is neither air nor nourishment enough , by reason of the great number of other Walnut - trees , which grow round about it .

Although I employed several ounces of cenanthylate of potassium , only a very inconsiderable quantity of an aromatic oil was obtained , which , in order to isolate the hydrocarbon C7 H , , , was first distilled with concentrated sulphuric acid , by the action of which sulphurous acid was evolved and a black charry matter separated out .	The oily distillate was well washed and further purified by means of nitric acid , caustic potash , and sodium , as described in my former papers , and then the small quantity of methyl - hexyl separated by fractional distillation from hcxyl , C , 1 H26 , which latter hydrocarbon is formed in by far the greatest proportion .

On inverting the eudiometer the gas was found to smell strongly of amylene , and there can be little doubt but that its presence prevented the explosion taking place .

It was afterwards shown by Berzelius that urea is colourless , and possesses no remarkable smell nor taste .	Proust , as mentioned above , attributed the colour , as well as the bitter taste and peculiar smell of urine , to his fallow resin .

The colour of its watery solution was exactly like that of urine .

The disagreeable odour which the watery solution of Lehmann ' s substance began to exhale when exposed to the air also points to some impurity .	Its acid reaction he attributes to an admixture of lactic acid , which was generally supposed to be contained in urine , until its entire absence was proved by the experiments of Liebig .

When the wind blew the vapours upon us , there was a distinct smell both of sulphurous and muriatic acids .	There was no indication of carbonaceous matter from the colour of the smoke ; nor was any deposited upon the yellow and white saline matter which surrounded the crater , and which I found to be principally sulphate and muriate of soda , and muriate of iron : in some specimens there was a considerable quantity of muriate of ammonia .

The solution contained magnesia , and nothing else besides salts of ammonia could be discovered .

To determine lime and magnesia 2000 grains ( in the latter experiments only 1000 grains ) were weighed , and mixed with so much of a solution of sal - ammoniac that pure ammonia did not produce any precipitate , then ammonia was added until the liquid had a strong smell thereof .	It was now precipitated with a solution of the common phosphate of soda and ammonia , and filtered when the precipitate had collected into a granular powder .
ro9406	smell	of sulphuretted hydrogen									Of these substances that have their origin from organic beings , I have already named ammonia ; but there are other substances of organic origin , probably of a more complicated nature , which I have observed in the following way .	If we pour one or two drops of a solution of hypermanganate of potash into fresh sea - water , which has no smell of sulphuretted hydrogen , we shall after a short time observe a change in the colour of the liquid , but it is hardly more than the first drop that is decomposed so soon after it has been mixed with sea - water .	The next decomposition goes slower , and is only finished after the liquid has been boiled for some time .
ro9406	smell	of sulphuretted hydrogen									While thus a portion of the sulphates always remains undecomposed , there also seems always to remain a portion of the organic matter unoxidized .	The sulphuretted hydrogen acts instantaneously upon hypermanganates , but when all smell of sulphuretted hydrogen has disappeared , there still remains some substance in putrefied sea - water which bleaches the hypermanganates when the water is boiled .	It may be one of the lower oxides of sulphur , or it may be that the organic substance was not fully oxidized .

The effects of these fumes , when inhaled , are very powerful and disagreeable , and even dangerous , I might venture to say , were I to speak from my own experience .	In one instance , when I inhaled only a small quantity , they produced in a few minutes a violent cough and catarrh , and apparent accumulation of blood in the neck and head , and symptoms altogether not unlike those the attendants of apoplexy , which continued for about a quarter of an hour , and then slowly diminished , and gradually disappeared with , cut leaving any permanent bad effect .

AMBERGRISE , or properly speaking Grey Amber , is a solid , opaque , inflammable substance , of a white grey , sometimes of a blackish colour , which melted or inflamed yields a peculiar smell , agreeable to most persons , but disagreeable to others .	As it occurs in the shops , it varies in its consistence , according as it has been exposed to a warmer or colder air .

It has in its natural state a peculiar strong smell .	The older it grows the more it seems to become agreeable .
ro9421	smell		more sensible						by rubbing it with the fingers|by burning or melting it		The older it grows the more it seems to become agreeable .	This smell is rendered more sensible by rubbing it with the fingers , or by burning or melting it .	It melts in a moderate degree of heat into a blackish thick oil , and then smoaks , skums , and flies by degrees entirely off , without leaving any coal behind ; so it does likewise when put upon any heated metal , leaving only a black spot upon it : when the metal is red - hot , it melts and inflames instantaneously , smoaks strongly , and flies speedily off , without leaving the least mark behind .
ro9421	smell	the faeces of the whale									As soon as they hook a whale of this description , torpid , sickly , emaciated , or one that does not dung on being hooked , they immediately either cut up the above - mentioned protuberance , if there be any , or they rip open its bowels from the orifice of the anus , and find the ambergrise , sometimes in one sometimes in different lumps of generally from three to twelve and more inches in diameter , and from one pound to twenty or thirty pounds in weight , at the distance of two , but most frequently of about six or seven feet from the anus , and never higher up in the intestinal canal , which , according to their description , is , in all probability , the intestinum caecum , hitherto mistaken for a peculiar bag made by nature for the secretion and collection of this singular substance .	That the part they cut open to come at the ambergrise is no other than the intestinal canal is certain , because they constantly begin their incision at the anus , and find the cavity every where filled with the faeces of the whale , which from their colour and smell it is impossible for them to mistake .	The ambergrise found in the intestinal canal is not so hard as that which is found on the sea or sea - coast , but soon grows hard in the air : when first taken out it has nearly the same colour , and the same disagreeable smell , though not so strong , as the more liquid dung of the whale has ; but , on exposing it to the air , it by degrees not only grows greyish , and its surface is covered with a greyish dust like old chocolate , but it also loses its disagreeable smell , and , when kept for a certain length of time , acquires the peculiar odour which is so agreeable to most people .

The gentlemen I conversed with confessed , that if they knew not from experience that ambergrise thus found will in time acquire the above - mentioned qualities , they would by no means be able to distinguish ambergrise from hard indurated faeces .

The asserVOL .
ro9421	smell	Ambergrise									Whether there is any material difference between ambergrise found upon the sea or sea - coast , and that found in the bowels or among the dung of the whale , either with regard to its qualities and chemical principles , or with respect to the heterogeneous substances that are mixed with it ? And 2dly , If there is any such difference , in what does it consist ? From the most exact information I have been able to procure on this subject , I find that what several authors have asserted , that all ambergrise found in whales is of an inferior quality , and therefore much less in price , is destitute of truth .	Ambergrise is only valued for its purity , lightness , compactness , colour , and smell .	There are pieces of ambergrise found on different coasts , which are of a very inferior quality , whereas there are often found pieces of it in whales of the first value ; nay , several pieces found in the same whale , according to the above - mentioned qualities , are more or less valuable .

All ambergrise found in whales has at first when taken out of the intestines very near the same smell as the liquid excrements of that animal have ; it has then also nearly the same blackish colour : they find it in the whale sometimes quite hard , sometimes rather softish , but never so liquid as the natural faeces of that animal .	And it is a matter of fact , that , after being taken out and kept in the air , all ambergrise grows not only harder and whiter , but also loses by degrees its smell , and assumes such an agreeable one , as that in general has which is found swimming upon the sea ; therefore the goodness of ambergrise seems rather to depend on its age .

The only reason why ambergrise found floating on the sea generally possesses the above - mentioned qualities in a superior degree , is because it is commonly older , and has been longer exposed to the air .
ro9421	perfume	ambergrise			frankincense						A sailor , however , who had the curiosity to try the effect of recent ambergrise upon himself , took half an ounce of it melted upon the fire , and found it a good purgative ; which proves , that it is not quite an inert substance .	In Asia and part of Africa ambergrise is not only used as a medicine and as a perfume , but a great use is also made of it in cookery , by adding it to several dishes as a spice ; a great quantity of it is also constantly bought by the Pilgrims who travel to Mecca , probably to offer it there , and make use of it in fumigations , in the same manner as frankincense is used in Catholic countries .	The Turks make use of it as an aphrodisiac .

The Cicada is common in Martinique , and in it ' s nympha state , in which the old authors call it Tettigometra , it buries itself under dead leaves to wait it ' s change ; and when the season is unfavourable , many perish .

To this and cleanliness , as well in the ship as amongst the people , too great attention cannot be paid ; the least neglect occasions a putrid , ofsensive smell below , which nothing but fires will remove : and if these be not used in time , those smells will be attended with bad consequences .	Proper care was taken of the ship ' s coppers , so that they were kept constantly clean .
ro9433	Smell	Filings of this Stone	fragrant						thrown into the Fire		ut supra .	cleave : Filings of this Stone thrown into the Fire emit a fragrant Smell ; and they cut kindly with a Knife , tho ' not so easily as other Wood ( a ) That this petrific Quality is in some peculiar Parts of the Lake , I have endeavoured to prove ; that it is or may be in some peculiar Places of the adjacent Ground , I grant ; tho ' , as yet , I could not procure any of those Stones found in the Ground , with Wood continuous .	Such as I have , or have seen , are of the white Whetstone - kind , and seem to be Holly or Ash , petrified by some strong nitrous and stony Particles ; for , in a Solution of it in Aqua fortis and Oil of Vitriol , it leaves no Tincture , but the Liquor growing muddy , like Pipe - Water after great Rains , therefore shows , that they are not so strongly impregnated with metalline Particles , as those Stones found in or on the Shores of the Lake .
ro9433	Smell	it	strong		of burning Charcoal						In other Stones I found some Veins of Wood , about one and two Inches thick , no way petrified , tho ' the Stones were every way so outwardly .	Some of that woody Part I also burnt in a Crucible ; it emitted a bluish Flame , as if impregnated with Sulphur , and had the strong Smell of burning Charcoal .	When burnt to a Coal , and reduced into Powder , it faintly yielded to the Magnet .
ro9433	Smell	of this Wood	strong						when burning		How Wood happens to be found in these Petrifications , sound and untouched , is somewhat surprising , and to account for it not very easy .	It may be attributed to this , that the Texture of the Wood is not every where equal ; especially where Knots happen , that Part is much harder and closer than any other ; and if the perrescent Particles should be once stopped , they will fix there , coagulate , and go no further ; by which means that Part of the Wood will remain free from Perrification , while the rest will be turned into Stone ; or the Pores of the Wood may happen in some Places , and in the very Heart of it , to be so full of a resinous Matter , that it will keep out the petrific Juices , and hinder their further penetrating into them equally : To this may be attributed the strong Smell of this Wood when burning ; and the more so , as I suspect that most of this petrified Wood was Fir , there being a good deal of that kind found daily in Turf - Pits near the Lake ; some not above twenty Yards Distance from it ; and the last Piece of Wood and Stone continuous that I have received , appearing by the Grain to be of that kind of Wood .	Lastly , the petrific Juices may happen to be so strongly impregnated with Salts and Metal , or any other mineral Particles , that they will immediately swell and fill the minutest Pores of the Wood , and , by a sudden Coalition , hinder their further penetrating into it ; which seems to appear clearly from some Cavities in one of these Stones , which I suppose to have been Worm - Holes , and which were no way filled by the petrescent Liquor which was stopped round it ; all the Sides of this Hole being overlaid with small brown Crystals , occasioned by the Evaporation of the aqueous Parts , and their being stopped and soaked by the neighbouring Stone or Wood .
ro9440	odour	of trimethylphosphine|of the phosphorus - compound	overpowering								The process is completed sooner , if possible , than in the ethyl - series .	The lower boiling - point and the overpowering odour of trimethylphosphine render it advisable to mix the materials with considerable quantities of alcohol or ether ; and on account of the extreme oxidability of the phosphorus - compound , it is best to operate in vessels filled with carbonic acid and subsequently sealed before the blowpipe .	After digestion for a slhort time at 1000 , the mixture of the two liquids solidifies to a hard , dazzling , white , crvstalline mass containing the two bromides , CA 113 P Br2 = [ ( C2 11 Br ) ( C II , ) , P ] Br , Ca H22 P2Br2 = ( C2 Ht I ( C H3 ) 3 p ] ) Br , , one or the other predominating according to the proportions in which the two bodies were allowed to act upon one another .
ro9470	smelling|fetid|fetid	Matter|Dung	strong|very fetid|fetid								It is sufficiently evident , that this Distemper , in the Cowkind , was a true Fever , from the coldness , rigor and standing up of the Hair of the Cattle at first , which was soon succeeded by a violent sharp burning , with a quick Pulse .	That this Fever was malignant , mortal and pestilential , its concomitant Symptoms plainly showed ; such as great uneasiness with difficulty ficulty of breathing , great pantings with a sort of snorting , and at the beginning a kind of Stupor and Drowsiness , a continual Flux of a strong smelling Matter from the Nose and Mouth , a very fetid Dung , sometimes with Blood , all Rumination ceasing , Pustules breaking out over the whole Body on the 5th or 6th day , like the Small Pox ; they all generally died about the 5th or 7th day , very few of them escaping .	The Author deduces this Distemper from a contagious Original .
ro9470	Effluvia	Cowhouses|Pastures									He tells us , it is certain , that out of a great Drove , such as the Merchants bring yearly into Italy out of Dalmatia and the bordering Countries , one Beast happened to straggle from the rest , and be left behind ; which a Cowherd finding , brought to a Farm belonging to the Illustrious and Reverend Count Borromeo , Canon of Padua : This Beast infected all the Cows and Oxen of the Place where he was taken in , with the same Distemper he laboured under ; the Beast it self dying in a few days , as did all the rest , except one only , who had a Rowel put into his Neck .	It is no strange thing therefore , if from the Effluvia , like an Atmosphere , proceeding from the sick Cattle , from those dead , and from Cowhouses and Pastures where they were fed , and by that means infected , and chiefly from the Cloaths of the Cowherds themselves , this Infection falling upon a proper Subject , should diffuse it self so largely .	Ramazzini not only supposes , but asserts , that this Poison is of that kind which rather fixes and coagulates , than dissolves the Blood : For besides the forementioned Symptoms accompanying the Disease , the Eye it self is a Witness ; since the dead Carcases being opened while they are yet hot , little or no Blood nevertheless runs out ; those Animals having naturally a thick Blood , especially when the Fever has continued so many Days .

In the earthquake of the 1st of November 1755 , we are told , that both smoke and light flames were seen on the coast of Portugal , near Colares ; and that , upon occasion of some of the succeeding shocks , a slight smell of sulphur was perceived to accompany a ` ` fog , which came from the sea , from the same quarter , whence the smoke appeared * .

We are told , that two or three days before an ~ earthquake in New England , the waters of some wells were rendered muddy , and stank intolerably : * This limit will depend upon the thickness of the matter necessary to prevent so quick a communication of the heat or cold through it , as that the water should be able to diminish the heat of the fire considerably .	The thickness requisite to do this , is very different in different kinds of bodies .

Yellow sulphide of cadmium evolved a trace of white sublimate before the gas liquefied ; in the liquid acid it became quite white , and remained undissolved in seven days ; on removal it was hard in texture and quite white throughout , and evolved no odour of sulphuretted hydrogen or separation of sulphur on treatment with strong nitric acid .	Bright tin evolved no visible gas in the liquid acid ; after ten days ' intermittent immersion it was converted , to some depth of its substance , into a bulky white solid with deep fissures .

Yellow iodide of lead did not dissolve in seven days , but became of a purplish brick - brown colour and evolved a strong odour of free iodine ; it produced yellowish - brown stains upon paper .	Yellow chromate of lead evolved at first ( in the gaseous acid ) a small quantity of deep - red vapour , which condensed as a red moisture near it on the tube ; the chromate became white in the gas , and did not dissolve in the liquid acid in three days ; it was then a soft white solid , not freely soluble in water , and imparted a faint greenish tint to water .

A minute fragment of iron remained bright , and evolved no gas when the liquid acid came into contact with it ; after nine days of intermittent immersion it was only slightly tarnished , and on removal from the acid was found otherwise unaltered .
ro9498	smell		peculiar	the wind			we				To leeward the sea was very much discoloured , and rendered turbid by ashes and dust ; and cinders in plenty , of a very light kind , were floating on the surface .	To ascertain if there was any peculiar smell belonging to the eruption , we passed a little within the skirts of the cloud , and the wind then freshening , we found ourselves in the midst of a dark shower of ashes , which fell with the force of fine hail , covered our persons , and almost blinded us .	It was not in the slightest degree heated ; indeed the wind that brought it , and which appeared to come from the atmosphere of the volcano , was unusually cool .

Excepting once or twice when we perceived a slight smell of sulphur , no unusual odour , not the slightest bituminous smell , or smell of sulphuretted hydrogen , or of sulphurous acid , or of any other acid fume was observable .	Shortly after we had pulled out of this cloud , the volcano became quiet ; and , the wind dispersing the vapour , the island appeared unobscured .

They were free from any odour , of a dirty fawn colour , from a fine dust which was suspended in them , and which on rest subsided ; after which they became perfectly clear and colourless .	The sediment obtained by filtering the water from the main crater ( about three pints ) weighed thirty grains .

The fibres resembling vegetable fibres consumed before the blowpipe , with a smell very like that of sea - weed burning ; and it may be conjectured that they were derived from sea - weed drawn into the crater .	The same kind of fibres , it may be remarked , were frequently to be seen on specimens of cinders brought from the volcano ; and their origin , it may be supposed , was the same .

The air remaining had a slight smell of sulphuretted hydrogen ; it extinguished a taper plunged into it , and was not itself inflammable ; 50 measures of it by limewater were reduced to 16 ; and these by phosphorus were reduced to 13 } ; sulphur sublimed in this residue occasioned no alteration of volume .	The air in the other bottle containing some water had no smell of sulphuretted hydrogen ; 48 measures of it by lime - water were reduced to 33 , and these by phosphorus to 31 ; and this residue was not inflammable , and extinguished flame .

The air in the other bottle containing some water had no smell of sulphuretted hydrogen ; 48 measures of it by lime - water were reduced to 33 , and these by phosphorus to 31 ; and this residue was not inflammable , and extinguished flame .	From these results it may be inferred that the gas in the first - mentioned bottle consisted chiefly of carbonic acid and azote and a little oxygen with a trace of sulphuretted hydrogen ; and that the gas in the second bottle was principally azote with a little oxygen and carbonic acid .

It is to be regretted that none of this gas was collected ; but , probably , it also was carbonic acid gas , and arising from the calcining effect of heat on the subjacent rocks forming the bed of the sea .

The Castle - Loed is a strong sulphureous mineral water ; when taken up from the spring , it is as pure and transparent as the clearest rock water ; but if kept in an open vessel , or an ill - corked bottle , it soon becomes of a milky sort of foulness , and it loses its strong sulphureous smell in twentyfour hours .	The bottom of the well , and of the channel which conveys its water from thence , is black , as if dyed with ink ; and the leaves of the aller bushes that fall into the well , or into its channel , soon contract a blackish colour in the water ; but when taken out , and dried in the sun or shade , appear covered with a whitish dust , which is undoubtedly sulphur ; for , by burning one or more on an ignited shovel , or clear live coal , they produce a blue flame , and emit a very suffocating sulphureous smell .

All that I can learn of the operation of this water , from some sensible people of credit and observation , who have drunk it this as well as former seasons , is , that it very sensibly increases the urine , and sometimes remarkably opens the pores ; but I do not find , from the report of any , that it purges , though drunk to the quantity of three , sometimes of four , English quarts in the day .
ro9520	smell	It	very strong sulphureous								The water was as clear and limpid as the purest rock water .	It had still a very strong sulphureous smell and taste ; but it had no other but a sulphureous taste , and it made no impression , on the tongue , of sea or any other salt .	Some of it was poured into different glasses and teacups , and different things put into each .

As soon as the water became warm , it lost its strong sulphureous smell , and there appeared some flakes of a dark brown light earth , which dropped to the bottom .	After about one half was evaporated , a very thin pellicle was observed on the surface , which precipitated to the bottom , and when it was reduced to about a pint ( lib .

It had rose into blisters , and emitted a very strong smell of sulphur , while it yet remained hot .	Some of the saline matter , being put into a solution of the caustic alkali in distilled water , occasioned a white cloud ; and the same thing happened when some ~ of it was mixed with solutions of silver in the nitrous acid , and of corrosive sublimate in distilled water .
ro9520	smell	it	very slight sulphureous								This matter was extremely bitter , and had likewise a cooling saline taste .	Some of it , put on a red - hot poker , melted , and rose into blisters ; it emitted a little smoke , but did not flame ; and it had such a very slight sulphureous smell , that it was doubtful whether it proceeded from the yellow matter or the ignited iron ; it burnt to a black coal , which tasted somewhat saltish .	Some oil of vitriol dropped on some of this matter occasioned very little effervescence , but raised a strong pungent acid smell , which I at first imagined must be that of sea salt ; but , from the few marks I have observed of the existence of this salt in a perfect state in these waters , I have since thought , that it might be that of a volatile vitriolic acid , which had been formed by the union of some of the acid of the Glauber salt , with a sulphureous or oily matter , and dislodged by the addition of a fixed acid of the same kind , though perhaps there may be a pittance of a calculareous marine salt in the yellow ley mixed with the Glauber salt .

Having accidentally added a solution of caustic alkali to this mixture of the yellow matter , and vitriolic acid , it emitted immediately a strong smell of hepar sulphuris .

This yellow matter I take to be composed of a Glauber salt , and a yellow oily matter common to almost every water , though perhaps in larger proportion in this than in many others ; but whether it contains a pittance of sea salt , I think is doubtful ; and what makes me still doubt the more , is my having since evaporated 44 ounces of the water , from which I obtained gr .

When part of the paper , with this powder , was lighted with a candle , and the flame extinguished , it smelt strong of sulphur ; and , on rubbing a shilling with another bit of the paper , it immediately tinged it yellow , as pure sulphur would have done .	From whence , I think , we have reason to conclude , that this powder contains more or less of a true genuine sulphur , or , at least , of a sulphureous matter .

From what has been said , it appears , that this is one of the strongest sulphureous waters hitherto found in Great Britain , though I make no doubt but that there are many such which have not hitherto been examined : That , in its natural state , it is highly impregnated with a volatile sulphureous vapour , which evaporates soon when exposed to the open air , and flies off immediately when exposed to heat ; and that the water then loses its strong sulphureous smell and taste , though we have the strongest reason to suspect that it still contains a sulphureous matter dissolved in it , by some means hitherto unknown to us ; for it neither contains an alkaline salt nor quicklime , the two only substances we hitherto know to be capable of dissolving sulphur , and keeping it suspended in water : That it lets drop to the bottom of the well , and of its channels , a fine powder of sulphur , which adheres to the leaves and branches of trees found there .	As this water contains but very little purging salt , and does not operate by stool , sea water , or some purging salt , may be added to the first glasses drank in a morning , when purging is required .

I subjected it to the same trials , as it : on opening the bottles , it emitted a strong sulphureous smell , tinged silver , and produced nearly the same appearances as the Castle - Loed when mixed with the same substances , only it remained clear when a solution of the true fossil alkali was mixed with it ; the caustic vegetable alkali occasioned a very small light , darkish cloud , and precipitated but a very small quantity of a very light sediment , owing , as appeared afterwards , to this water containing an absorbent or calcarious earth , which probably was suspended by air , and but very little if any selenite .	I evaporated lib .

The solution of the fossil alkali mixed clear , as did a solution of salt of tartar , but each drop of a solution of common caustic alkali gave a white cloud ; some oil of vitriol dropped on a little of this salt effervesced , and emitted acid fumes , while it yet was mixed with a good deal of the yellow oily matter ; but after the salt was dissolved in distilled water , and again crystallised , and freed of most of this yellow matter , no fumes were to be observed ; and the acid smell was extremely faint when strong spirit or oil of vitriol was dropped upon it .	This , though it does not appear to be such a strong sulphureous water as the Castle - Loed , yet it may have its uses , and be serviceable to those who have not an opportunity of using the other ; and it may perhaps be useful in some cases , where the other may not agree .

It had then a fetid sulphureous smell , resembling somewhat that of a foul gun or of rotten eggs , and it tinged silver in the same way as the sulphureous waters beforementioned ; and it had a sulphureous and slight saltish taste .	This fetid sulphureous smell , taste , and property of tinging silver , which this as well as most other salt waters acquire by keeping , I suspect to be owing to a fermentation taking place in the water , and slightly uniting some of the fine oily matter with some of the acid of the salts which these waters contain , and thus forming a sulphureous vapour which is volatile while they remain slightly united , but which by a more intimate union would form a real fixed sulphur .

But however that might be , this I ' m assured of from frequent Experiments , that the Marble of the Giants Causway , like these Stony Beams , when forcibly struck with another Stone or a Bar of Iron , sends forth a strong offensive Scent like Burnt Horn .	But I shall forbear making any more of these kind of Remarks or raising Deductions from them , considering that I write to one whose accurate Observations , vast Reading , and ample Experience in Fossils , can , if he please , furnish me with those that are so much more Instructive and Judicious than my own : and shall therefore add no more , but entreat you to let me know your particular Sense of this wonderful Product of Nature , and your impartial Censure of what I have said concerning it ; and then I shall quite accomplish all that I proposed to my self by troubling you with this , the acquiring Knowledge , and showing you that I am , Dublin , March YOU R ' s , & amp ; c .
ro9540	odour	of bitter almond oil	faint					during|during the|the whole|whole course|course of|of the|the	during|during the|the whole|whole course|course of|of the|the ebullition		A few brownish crystalline flocks appear in the solution , and after cooling , the cake of resin - like substance is found harder and less fusible than hydrobenzamide which has been nielted and left to solidify .	This change is unaccompanied by any notable alteration of weight , although a faint odour of bitter almond oil is disengaged during the whole course of the ebullition .	The new substance is an olganic salt - base , having the same composition as hydrobenzalnide itself ; it might perhaps with propriety be called benzoline .
ro9540	odour	of benzine									Heated in a retort , it boils and at length entirely volatilizes , with scarcely a residue of charcoal .	Ammonia is disengaged during the distillation , a highly volatile oily liquid , having the odour of benzine , collects in the receiver , and a crystalline solid matter condenses in the neck of the retort .	This latter substance , which seems to be the most abundant product , has been but partially examined ; ittis described below under the name pyrobenzoline .
ro9540	oxidizing	benzoline									This latter substance , which seems to be the most abundant product , has been but partially examined ; ittis described below under the name pyrobenzoline .	The action of oxidizing agents upon benzoline is remarkable .	When heated in a retort with a mixture of bichromate of potash , sulphuric acid and water , it is attacked with great energy , the mixture becomes dark green , and on distillation benzoic acid in large quantity passes over with the vapour of water .

I have seen the same appearance on mixing serum that had been kept three days in a warm place , and smelt putrid , with fresh - drawn human blood ; the vesiele assumed this globular and mulberry - like appearance .	In these experiments on human blood beginning to putrefy , I have likewise observed some of these vesicles break into pieces without becoming spherical ; and I have distinctly perceived the black spot in the center fissured through its middle , another proof that it is not a perforation .
ro9551	smell	Sulphur									And here after an accurate Enumeration of the several kinds both Native and Factitious , having examined upon Chemical Principles its Composition , he accounts for its operation much after the same manner , as for Sublimate Corrosive : There being here also cutting Salts and a Rugalus to give them weights and force .	Only it is to be observed , that the Sulphur discoverable in Arsenick both by smell and its inslammability , serve as an additional Vinculum to the wounding Spicula , and by its heat to inflame the Wounds which they have made .	He concludes this Essay with wonder at a dangerous custom that hath prevailed among some to wear a bag of this Corrosive Mineral at the pit of the Stomach , as an A nulet against the Plague .
ro9553	smell	its	oily								313 .	] After describing the geological locality and the external character of the above mineral , and adverting particularly to its oily smell , Mr .	Knox proceeds to show , by its chemical analysis , that , exclusive of the constituents of this substance ascertained by Klaproth , it contains a considerable but variable proportion of a peculiar bitumen , separable from it by distillation at high temperatures .
ro9564	stink	his Water	very|to that degree				A Neighbour of mine				I am now come to the 28th of November , and having met with some further Particulars omitted in the preceding Account : I shall throw them into a Postscript .	A Neighbour of mine , that has a Well 36 Feet deep , about three Days before the Earthquake , was surprised to find his Water , that used to be very sweet and lympid , stink to that degree , that they could make no Use of it , nor scarce bear the House when it was brought in ; and thinking some Carrion was got into the Well , he searched the Bottom , but found it clear and good , though the Colour of the Water was turned wheyish or pale .	In about seven Days after the Earthquake , his Water began to mend , and in three Days more returned to its former Sweetness and Colour .
ro9564	Stink|Smell	of Sulphur	such|strong					immediately after|that Night		that the Family could scarce bear to be in the House for	I am also very credibly informed , that several Springs and good Watering - Places were some of them lowered , and others quite sunk and lost with the Earthquake .	A worthy Divine in a Town about twenty Miles distant from Boston , assures me , that immediately after the Earthquake , there was such a Stink or strong Smell of Sulphur , that the Family could scarce bear to be in the House for a considerable Time that Night .	The like is confirmed also from other Places .
ro9569	odour	garlic|garlic	garlic|garlic		similar to that evolved from phosphorus				produced by agitating in distilled water the clot obtained from some specimens of venous blood		& amp ; c .	The author states that he was first led to the new theory he has formed for the explanation of the chemical phenomena of respiration , and more especially of the change in the colour of the blood which occurs in that process , by having observed that a garlic odour , similar to that evolved from phosphorus , was produced by agitating in distilled water the clot obtained from some specimens of venous blood .	His attention was consequently directed to the investigation of the state in which the phosphorus exists in the blood ; and the result of that investigation was the theory , of which the following is a succinct outline .
ro9570	smell						The author		under the microscope		Pus from vomicae , consequent on simple inflammation .	The author next treats more at large of the sensible or obvious properties , including smell , taste , weight relative to water , and appearance under the microscope .	The next division of the subject includes the agency of heat ; the separation of a coagulum , or curd , at temperatures from 150 ? to 170 ? ; the properties of the curd , and of the residuum which it leaves when burned ; the saline contents of the fluid separated from the curd , and obtained by evaporation .
ro9581	odour	It|of|of			of|of oil gas						The substance appears as a thin light fluid ; sometimes transparent and colourless , at others opalescent , being yellow or brown by transmitted , and green by reflected light .	It has the odour of oil gas .	When the bottle containing it is opened , evaporation takes place from the surface of the liquid ; and it may be seen by the strix in the air that vapour is passiitg off from it .
ro9581	odour	Bi - carburet of hydrogen			resembling that of oil gas|of that of almonds						Then proceed with these as before described .	It will sometimes happen , when the proportion of bi - carburet of hydrogen is small in the liquid , that the rectifications must be many times repeated before the fluids at 185 ? and 190o will deposit crystals on cooling ; that is to say , before sufficient of the permanently fluid part at low temperatures has been removed , to leave a solution so saturated as to crystallize at o ? Bi - carburet of hydrogen appears in common circumstances as a colourless transparent liquid , having an odour resembling that of oil gas , and partaking also of that of almonds .	Its specific gravity is nearly 0 .
ro9581	odour	of the substance with|with the|the	exceedingly		like that of almonds				with|with the|the acid		When cooled to 32 ? , the substance became solid and of a fine red colour , which disappeared upon fusion .	The odour of the substance with the acid was exceedingly like that of almonds , and it is probable that hydrocyanic acid was formed .	When washed with water , it appeared to have undergone little or no change .
ro9581	odour	the acid	peculiar|turbid								Sometimes the condensation is perfect , at other times a small quantity of residual gas is left , which burns with a pale blue flame , and seems to be a product of too rapid action .	Great heat is produced during the action ; no sulphurous acid is formed ; the acid is much blackened , has a peculiar odour , and upon dilution generally becomes turbid , but no gas is evolved .	A permanent compound of the acid with carbon and hydrogen is produced , and enters as before mentioned into combination with bases .
ro9581	vapour|vapour			vapour|vapour							8 .	As the proportions of the elements in this vapour appear to be the same as in olefiant gas , it became interesting to ascertain whether chlorine had the same action upon it as on the latter body .	Chlorine and the vapour were therefore mixed in an exhausted retort : rapid combination took place , much heat was evolved , and a liquor produced resembling hydro - chloride of carbon , or the substance obtained by the same process from olefiant gas .
ro9593	smell|smell	of nitric acid|of aqua regia							on adding the smallest quantity of nitre to the same mixture		I had suspected that some nitric salt might be found in seawater , but in this I was disappointed .	The discrimination by the shape of the crystals being in this instance scarcely practicable , the mode which I employed for detecting it , consisted in concentrating the bittern in a glass tube or retort , till it began to deposit solid matter , then adding sulphuric acid and gold - leaf , and boiling the mixture ; the gold - leaf was not in the least acted upon , nor was any smell of nitric acid perceived ; but on adding the smallest quantity of nitre to the same mixture , the gold was dissolved , and the smell of aqua regia was instantly perceived .	* A portion of the said bittern was next , examined by appropriate re - agents , with a view to detect any minute quantity of earths or metals , especially alumina , silica , iron and copper , which former inquirers might have overlooked ; but I could find no other earth except magnesia : and to my surprise , I did not find in the bittern the least particle of lime , which proves that sea - water contains no muriate of lime , as had been generally supposed .
ro9596	odour		slight|peculiar|not disagreeable								It is obtained by sinking wells of about 60 feet in depth , in which the liquid is collected by the miner as it oozes from the soil .	At the common temperature this substance has the consistence of goose - fat ; it is lighter than water , has usually a greenish - brown colour , and possesses a slight odour , peculiar , but not disagreeable .	It consists almost entirely of volatile constituents .
ro9596	Oxidizing	the IHydrocarbons									) with chlorine for some months , we at last obtained a cessation of all action , and a chlorine compound resulted , which , when purified and analysed , gave numbers agreeing perfectly with C26 H22 C ' I , corresponding to a hydrocarbon , C2 128 , a formula with which the analysis of the original hydrocarbon was perfectly consistent , although its boiling - point pointed rather to a lower formula .	Action of Oxidizing Agents on the IHydrocarbons .	By the action of boiling diluted nitric acid , continued for many months , on the hydrocarbons not acted upon by concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids , oxidation gradually takes place , and a great variety of acids are produced , among which we have isolated succinic acid , and several others belonging to the series Cl , H - _ 2 O ^ s Oxalic acid , the lowest term of this series , could not be traced ; there occurs , however , in these products several of the volatile acids of the acetic acid series , but in very small quantities .
ro9599	smell		pungent	the air			he				He employed 2 oz = 960 grains of nitre : the retort was placed in an air furnace , and , by means of an intense heat , he obtained from the nitre in one experiment 787 , and in another experiment 800 ounce measures of dephlogisticated air ; and he found that , upon weighing the retort and nitre before and after the process , they had suffered a loss of weight equal to the weight of the air , and to the water of crystallization of the nitre , but nothing more .	He remarked , that the air had a pungent smell , which he could not divest it of by washing ; and that the water in which the air was received had become slightly acid .	I examined a portion of this water , which he was so kind as to send me , and found by it that the whole of the receiving water had contained the acid belonging to 2 drams = 120 grains of nitre .
ro9599	fumes		yellowish	this air				during			Encouraged by the success of this experiment , I took an ounce = 480 grains of pure common nitre , and put it into a flint - glass retort , coated , which was placed in a furnace .	It began to give air about the time it became red - hot , and during the latter part of the process this air was accompanied with yellowish fumes .	I stopped the process when it had produced 50 ounce measures of air .
ro9599	smell	of nitrous acid	strong|peculiar	The receiving water|the air							I stopped the process when it had produced 50 ounce measures of air .	The receiving water , and particularly the air , had a strong but peculiar smell of nitrous acid .	The air was well washed with the receiving water , but was not freed from the smell .
ro9599	smell			The air							The receiving water , and particularly the air , had a strong but peculiar smell of nitrous acid .	The air was well washed with the receiving water , but was not freed from the smell .	The receiving water , which was 50 ounces , was slightly acid , and the residuum alkaline .

The Pulse of the place being felt , upon it they place the Moxa ( the basis of the Cone next the Skin ) , then taking care to keep the body in a settled position , they light the Apex of the Pellet either with ordinary wood , or ( for the Rich ) with an Aromatic stick .	The Pellet does not wholly consume into ashes ; but leaves a little segment of its base on the part : a little Blister is hereby raised of a Cineritious colour without much pain , giveing vent to the humours and wind .
ro9604	smell	of Rose - water									To Confirm his notion of Winds being the cause of most diseases , our Author subjoyns an History of a Febris Cardiaca ( as he calls it ) which afflicted himself almost to Death , with most vehement palpitations of his heart , frequent Swoonings , intermittent pulse , difficult breathing , burning heat : which ending in a colliquateing sweat left him weak and languishing with hands and feet as cold & amp ; insensible as a carcass .	The smell of Rose - water was his most reviveing Cordial he could find ; breaking wind up or down eased him always : but Clysters bringing away much wind was his chief and almost only relief .	What came away by Stool affected him inwardly with so strange a sense of cold , as if Ice newly thawed had been ejected .

ro9606	smell	it	very		like that of sulphuretted hydrogene				on pouring a little diluted muriatic acid into the mixture		e .	the potash , a peculiar compound , soluble in water ; and this I found to be the case ; for on pouring a little diluted muriatic acid into the mixture , it effervesced violently , and gave a smell very like that of sulphuretted hydrogene ; metallic tellurium was formed where it came in contact with the air , and muriate of potashl was found dissolved in the mixture .	It seemed evident from this fact , ~ that in the : action of tellurium negatively electrified upon potash , potassium was produced as in all other cases , and that it combined with the tellurium , and formed a peculiar alloy ; and this opinion was farther confirmed , by the immediate action of potassium iuplo tellurium .
ro9606	infusible|infusible		infusible|infusible						at		It seemed evident from this fact , ~ that in the : action of tellurium negatively electrified upon potash , potassium was produced as in all other cases , and that it combined with the tellurium , and formed a peculiar alloy ; and this opinion was farther confirmed , by the immediate action of potassium iuplo tellurium .	When these metals were gently heated in a retort of green glass , filled with hydrogene gas , they combined with : great energy , producing most vivid heat and light , and they : composed an alloy of a dark copper hue , brittle , infusible at a heat below redness , and possessing a crystalline fracture .	, When the tellurium was in excess in this mixture , or even - nearly equal to the potassium in quantity , no hydrogene was evolved by the action of the alloy upon water .
ro9606	smell	of the two substances	almost precisely the same								The compound of tellurium and hydrogene , is more analogous to sulphuretted hydrogene , than to any other body .	The smell of the two substances is ' almost precisely the same .	* Its aqueous solution is of a claret colour ; but it soon becomes brown , and deposits tellurium , - yiexpo .
ro9606	smell	Their	intensely ftid								But : from a repetition of the process I find , thaa tholgh potast is decompounded in this operation , yet that the volatile substgni , ts nisot an aliQ1 poftassium , but contains charcoal and arsenic , probably with hydrogene , The gasses not absorbable by water given off in this operation , are peculiar .	Their smell is intensely ftid .	They are inflammable , and seem to contain charcoal , arsenic , and hydrogene : whether they are mixtures of various gasses , or a single compound , I am not at present able to decide .
ro9606	smell	sulphur	ammoniacal								Mr .	KIRWAN observed the fact that when nitrous gas , and sulphuretted hydrogene , are kept in contact for some time , there is a great diminution of volume , and that the nitrous gas becomes converted into nitrous oxide , and that sulphur is deposited which has an ammoniacal smell .	I repeated this experiment several times in i8oo with similar results , and I found , that the diminution of the volume of the gasses when they were mixed in equal proportions , was to rather less than , which seemed to be nitrous oxide .
ro9608	olfactory|olfactory		olfactory|olfactory								The inner or cerebral surface was concave , and formed a large part of the superior lateral boundary of the cranial cavity .	The ethmoid bone consisted , first , of a cerebral surface , or cribriform plate , situated between the frontal and sphenoid bones ; it presented a median ridge ( crista - galli ) , on each side of which existed three or four deep depressions perforated by foramrina for the exit of the olfactory nerves .	Secondly , in the interior of the nares it presented four irregularly shaped turbinated bones that were situated internal and superior to the nasal canals ; these bones were soft and spongy , and were separated from each other by three meatuses posteriorly , but anteriorly they communicated in common with the air - passages .
ro9612	smell	of ammonia									The solutions were mixed , and being neutralized at a boiling temperature by carbonate of ammonia , and the iron separated , a green solution remained .	Into this when boiling , a drop of persulphate of iron being let fall , was immediately precipitated in the state of subsulphate , which being separated , the solution was boiled with excess of caustic potash till all smell of ammonia disappeared .	Oxide of nickel separated , which collected and strongly ignited , weighed 4 - 65 grains , or 12 ' 92 on the hundred , which ( taking the atom of nickel to weigh So , and that of oxygen 8 , hydrogen being unity ) gives X o ' 2o per cent for the contents of the specimen analyzed in metallic nickel .

Where are enumerated the several sorts of Vessels , which being filled with water , and exposed to the cold Air , do burst ; and where also the weight is expressed , that will be removed by the expansive force of Freezing ? Whereunto an Inquiry is subjoined , whence the prodigious force , observed in water , expanded by Glaciation , should proceed ? And whether this Phenomenon may be solved , either by the Cartesian , or Epicurean Hypothesis ? 11 .	What is the Sphere of Activity of Cold , or the Space , to whose extremities every way the Action of a cold Body is able to reach : where the difficulty of determining these limits , together with the causes thereof , being with much circumspection mentioned , it is observed , that the Sphere of Activity of Cold is exceeding narrow , not only in comparison of that of Heat in Fire , but in comparison of , as it were , the Atmosphere of many odorous Bodies ; and even in comparison of the Sphere of Activity of the more vigorous Loadstones , insomuch , that the Author hath doubted , whether the Sense could discern a Cold Body , otherwise then by immediate Contract .	Where several Experiments are delivered for the examining of this matter , together with a curious relation of the way used in Persia , though a very hot Climate , to fnrnish their Conservatories with solid pieces of Ice of a considerable thickness : To which is added an Observation , how far in Earth and Water the Frost will pierce downwards , and upon what accounts the deepness of the Frost may vary .
ro9624	stench		putrid|disagreeable				to him				I must beg leave to say , that to my knowlege the distemper in February 1756 was carried from the farm - yard , where I visited some distempered cattle , to two other farm - yards , each at a considerable distance , without any communication of the cattle with each other , and merely by the means of servants going to and fro , or of dogs .	The experiments made on four beasts , by tying over their heads part of distempered hides , or pieces of linen and woollen cloth or silk , which had received the breath and steams of dying cattle , serve to show , by the bullock ' s forcing off the cloth tied about him , that the putrid stench was disagreeable to him ; but that neither his blood , nor that of the other three beasts , was then in a state to receive the infection .	With regard to the pustules , which the Marquis relates were mixed with oats and bran , or dissolved in white wine ; the distempered bile , which was mixed with milk ; milk taken from diseased cows ; water , in which part of a distempered hide had been steeped ; and the precaution taken to force these mixtures into the paunch of calves , by means of a funnel , whose end was covered with a piece of raw distempered skin , that the beast might both swallow and suck in the disease .
ro9632	smells	the octylchloride			like oranges						A considerable portion distilled now at 119 ? - 122 ? , but by far the largest quantity at 122 ? - 125 ? .	From this latter portion I prepared the octylchloride , a colourless liquid , which smells like oranges , and boils at 173 ? 176 ? .	This chloride was heated up to 200 ? for several hours with concentrated acetic acid and potassium acetate .
ro9632	odour		pleasant|pleasant		pleasant|pleasant pear - like						It was thus completely decomposed ; the chief product of the reaction consisted of octylene , besides that a much smaller quantity of octyl - acetate had been formed .	This ether is a colourless liquid , boiling at 2000 - 2050 , and having a pleasant pear - like odour .	It was converted into octyl - alcohol by heating it with an alcoholic solution of caustic potash .
ro9632	odour	of methyl - hexyl carbinol									It was converted into octyl - alcohol by heating it with an alcoholic solution of caustic potash .	This alcohol , after being purified by washing it several times with water , and drying over fused potassium carbonate , was obtained as a colourless oily liquid , boiling at 180 ? - 182 ? , and possessing exactly the odour of methyl - hexyl carbinol .	The alcohol was oxidized by mixing it slowly with a cold solution of 2 parts of potassium dichromate and 3 parts of sulphuric acid in 10 parts of water , care being taken to avoid as much as possible any elevation of temperature during the reaction .
ro9632	odour	of methyl - aeuanthol									The liquid was shaken from time to time , and distilled after a few hours .	The acid distillate was neutralized with sodium carbonate ; only a small quantity of an acid was formed ; the chief oxidation - product consisted of a neutral oil , having the odour of methyl - aeuanthol , and , like this compound , it formed with hydrogensodium sulphite a crystalline compound .	The liquid having no constant boiling - point , and the quantity being only small , I did not analyze it , but oxidised it further by heating it with the chromic - acid solution .
ro9632	smell	The octyl - chloride	faint		orange - like						I have already described this hydrocarbon in a former communication ; it boils constantly at 124 ? C .	The octyl - chloride obtained from it has only a faint orange - like smell ; it boils at 174 ? - 176 ? .	Heated with concentrated acetic acid and potassium - acetate to 200 ? , it is decomposed after a few hours , octyl - acetate and octylene being formed in about equal quantities , whilst the chloride obtained from petroleum gave about three times more octylene than acetate .
ro9632	odour	This acetate|pear|pear			pear|pear - like						Heated with concentrated acetic acid and potassium - acetate to 200 ? , it is decomposed after a few hours , octyl - acetate and octylene being formed in about equal quantities , whilst the chloride obtained from petroleum gave about three times more octylene than acetate .	This acetate boils at 19 ' 8 ? - 202 ? , and has the same pear - like odour as that described above .	The alcohol prepared from it by heating it with an alcoholic solution of caustic potash , had no constant boiling - point ; it distilled between 180 ? and 190 ? ; the greatest portion between 182 ? and 186 ? ; its odour is very much like that of methyl - hexyl carbinol .
ro9632	odour	its	very much		like that of methyl - hexyl carbinol						This acetate boils at 19 ' 8 ? - 202 ? , and has the same pear - like odour as that described above .	The alcohol prepared from it by heating it with an alcoholic solution of caustic potash , had no constant boiling - point ; it distilled between 180 ? and 190 ? ; the greatest portion between 182 ? and 186 ? ; its odour is very much like that of methyl - hexyl carbinol .	As I had only about 4 grammes , I could not subject it to fractional distillation .
ro9632	smell|smells	The essential oil of these seeds|an octyl acetate|that	strongly		an orange - like|of pears			198 ? - 202 ?			The primary alcohol appears to differ from the primary octyl alcohol , which has been found lately by Zincke in the seeds of Heracleum slpondylium * .	The essential oil of these seeds consists chiefly of an octyl acetate , boiling at 2060 - 208 ? , and possessing an orange - like smell , whilst that which I obtained smells strongly of pears , and boils at 198 ? - 202 ? .	By oxydising his alcohol , Zincke obtained a caprylic acid , which solidified at 12 ? , whilst the acid which I got remained liquid at 0 ? .
ro9634	fetid|fetid	Pus	fetid|fetid				I	Towards the Middle of January		that	In 8 or 9 Days time a plentiful Suppuration came on , and his Fever abated .	Towards the Middle of January , the Discharge of fetid Pus was so great , not only through the Wound , but also by Expectoration , that I thought he could not long survive it : At each Time of Dressing ( which was Morning and Evening , till the Quantity lessened ) full six Ounces of Pus were discharged : The like Quantity he would generally cough up between the Dressings .	When the Dressings were removed , I frequently made him force a Cough , and try if he could not throw out any Pus by his Mouth ; but , instead of passing that Way , it flew out thro ' the Wound , like Water from a Pump : If I blocked up the Wound with Tow , he could then freely discharge it by the Mouth .
ro9634	fetid|fetid|Stink	The Matter	prodigiously fetid|fetid|scarce tolerable			in the Chamber				that	When the Matter had done flowing , the Air which was forced thro ' the Wound by Coughing , would blow out a Candle , which I often experienced .	The Matter was so prodigiously fetid , that , for some time after he was dressed , the Stink in the Chamber was scarce tolerable ; and it was near the Middle of March before the Discharge began to abate .	In this Space of Time he coughed up 25 Shot ; had frequently hectic Heats , and NightSweats ; a quick feverish Pulse returned constantly towards Evening , with great Thirst ; he had lost his Appetite , and was greatly emaciated ; his chief Food was Milk , and Physic the Bark .
ro9634	fetid|fetid	Pus	fetid|fetid								About the Middle of June the Wound was quite cicatriz ' d , 2 or 3 Exfoliations being first cast off from the Scapula .	His Cough still continued with a Discharge of the same fetid Pus , but in three Weeks it began to abate ; and , towards the latter End of July , he had gained Flesh , and his Cough had left him ; he walked abroad , and was , to Appearance , quite recovered .	But this fair Prospect did not last long ; for , towards the latter End of August , I was called to him in the Night , and found him supported in the Bed , with a Half - pint Bason in his Hand , almost full of the same Sort of stinking putrid Matter , which he used to cough up : It had been emptied but a Quarter of an Hour before , so that , in less than half an Hour , he had expectorated a full Pint .

But this fair Prospect did not last long ; for , towards the latter End of August , I was called to him in the Night , and found him supported in the Bed , with a Half - pint Bason in his Hand , almost full of the same Sort of stinking putrid Matter , which he used to cough up : It had been emptied but a Quarter of an Hour before , so that , in less than half an Hour , he had expectorated a full Pint .	This Cough continued upon him 16 Hours longer ; when , the Load of Matter being pumped up , he grew much better .
ro9634	fetid|fetid	Pus	fetid|fetid								He had three of these violent Returns before the Summer was quite over , which reduced him nearly to his former weak State , but discharged no Shot .	In November following , I laid on a Caustic to the Cicatrix of the Wound in his Back ; and kept it open with a large Bean , to try if a Discharge , by way of Issue , might divert the Matter from coming by the Mouth : He had no such violent Seizures afterward , but still a hectic Cough upon him , which expectorated a small Quantity of the same fetid Pus : The Discharge from the Issue was pretty considerable , and he weathered out the Winter tolerable well .	In March 1739 , he grew feverish , and complained of a great Load and Pain just above the Diaphragm , on the Left Side : I applied a warm Plaister , and drew off ten Ounces of Blood , which I found was pretty much inflamed .

A few Days afterwards an Abscess formed between the Ribs , where he had before complained plained of the Pain ; which I opened , and discharged about four Ounces of the same fetid Matter , and 18 Shot .	Here was a true Empyema , and I had now great Hopes of a Cure , Nature having pointed out such a depending Part , for a Discharge of what Matter might be lodged in the Thorax .

I then healed up the Issue in his Back , and kept this new Wound open with a Cannula ; but , within ten Days , the Matter had ceased flowing , his feverish Symptoms again increased , and his Cough returned with a Discharge of the same putrid Matter .	I threw aside the Cannula , and healed the Wound between the Ribs , it answering no End to keep it open longer , The remaining Part of the Year 1739 , he had several Returns of his Cough , with pretty large Expectorations , but they were not of long Continuance ; frequent Bleedings , a Milk - Diet , and vulnerary Medicines , were made use of .

Towards the latter End of March 1743 , his Cough returned again with the same usual Violence , and the Discharge in One Night was a full Pint of fetid bloody Pus ; half that Quantity was expectorated next Day .	He had the same feverish Symptoms a few Days before this Cough , as usual , but rather more severe .

I confess I was somewhat surprised at this matter ; since there are who say , that even the other Shells , that are commonly called petrify ' d , yield a Volatil Salt : and I had my self from the Shells of Crustaceous Fishes , ( particularly of Lobsters ) had a Volatil Salt and fetid Oil in no inconsiderable quantity , even in a Sand Furnace .	But these sort of Shells differ from other Shells ( as you have exactly observed ) in this too , Quod in his umbo ad cardinem leviter rostratus est , qui tamen in Ostreis paulum aliter est .

Addition of water to the alcoholic solution precipitates this compound as an oily liquid , which , when slowly deposited by spontaneous evaporation from its solution in alcohol or ether , separates in beautiful crystalline plates of an agreeable aromatic odour and burning taste .	One or two recrystallizations render this substance perfectly pure .

Near the Ground grow One or Two hollow Flowers , each upon its proper Foot - stalk , different in Form from the Pistolochia Cretica , or any other yet known ; all whose Flowers ( if Authors Figures , or the Plants themselves dried , rightly inform me ) resemble a Cows Horn , the top growing to the Rudiment of the Seed - Vessel , and the open end cut slaunting like a Drenching - Horn , whereas this of ours terminetes with a Heel , which supports a broad , round , galerniculated Lip , the Center of which opens into the Hollow of the Flower .
ro9660	Smell		very offensive								The next Day we went together ; and when we came , I desired he would examine her , which he did ; and after having heard all her Complaints , said , He was of Opinion , that there was some Abscess forming in ( or in Contact with ) the Uterus , which , very likely , in a little time , would break and discharge itself ; but as , at that time , nothing of a Child could be perceived by the Touch , so he was obliged to submit that to the Credit of my Opinion , who had before frequently felt it .	Thus she continued for about a Fortnight after this Visit ; when , calling on her one Day , she told me , she was much easier than she had been ; and that something came constantly draining away by the Anus , of a very offensive Smell , which , upon Examination , appeared to be true Pus .	I now began to think Dr .

Upon opening it , we discovered a Mass of fetid Pus , in which the Bones of a Faetus , of about 5 or 6 Months old , were buried .	These Bones were , for the most part , wholly divested of their Flesh ; so that the Edges of the thin Bones must , of Necessity , cut and irritate from every Motion of the Body .

Upon this he stepped back , and not only saw it again , but found that the farther he went from it , the stronger and brighter it grew ; nor could he upon narrowly viewing the Place where this fiery Appearance was , perceive the least Blackness , or Smell , or any Mark of an actual Fire .	The same Observation was confirmed to me by another Gentleman , who frequently travels that Way , and who assured me , that he had seen the very same Light five or six different Times , in Spring and Autumn , and that he had always observed it in the very same Shape and the same Place , which to me seems very difficult to be accounted for .

Spring - water , in which he dissoly ' d betwixt one and two drachms of Sal marine in Frigido ( since about that quantity of Common Salt the Sulphur - water in the North contains , ) he added to this Solution of Salt in water , about two or three ounces of Calx Vive and the Marcasites of Vitriol ( found near the Sulphur - Well ) grossly pulverised ; which presently became considerably hot : whereupon pouring off some of the Water , he poured into the same , filtred , a little Solution of the simple AlomeSalt ; and it immediately caused a precipitation of a Sulphur , and sent forth the very smell , and had also the exact taste of the SulphurWell .	Again ; That , seeing all Bodies are but Concretions and Hardnings of their primitive Juyces , under various disguises , generally performed by the operation of the Air , therefore the Preparation of a Dissolvent by Art , ( which may work wonders in this kind ) is no more , to him , than to make such an one , as may soften these Concretions , made by the Air , and by taking away their hardness , reduce them into their first Juicy Liquors .

ro9688	odour		strong musky								A gland of this kind subsists beneath the lower jaw of the alligator and crocodile .	It is situated on each side , and secretes an unctuous substance of a strong musky odour .	Neither its structure nor its probable object have yet been considered with any care , till the author , about two years ago , discovered in it a structure which he thinks is without a parallel in the glandular system of other animals .
ro9688	smell	of musk									His observations were made on the common alligator of America .	In this animal the external orifice of the gland is situated about two thirds of the length of the lower jaw backwards from the symphysis , being a longitudinal slit a little within the lower edge of the basis of the jaw , and through it exudes an unctuous substance of the consistence of suet and the smell of musk .	During warm weather , when the animal feeds freely , the secretion is copious ; but in winter is much diminished in quantity , and less powerful in scent .

During warm weather , when the animal feeds freely , the secretion is copious ; but in winter is much diminished in quantity , and less powerful in scent .	The gland , on removing the integuments , is seen lying between the skin and under - surface of the tongue .
ro9688	odoriferous|odoriferous	oils|extracts	odoriferous|odoriferous								The use of the muscle seems to be to bring the gland into a proper position for discharging its contents , and to operate such discharge by its pressure .	The author , taking into consideration the situation of the gland near the mouth of the alligator , its predatory habits and voracity of fish , and the well - known partiality of fish for odoriferous oils and extracts , conceives that the use of this secretion is to act as a bait , and attract the fish to such a position that he can easily seize on them , in his usual way of seizing his prey , by snapping sideways at them .	The greater part of it is soluble in alcohol and water .

The substance obtained by evaporation , both from the aqueous and alcoholic solution , is light yellow , and transparent ; has a faint and peculiar smell different fromthat of the toad , and it is slightly bitter , and very acrid , acting on the tongue like the extract of aconite prepared in vacuo , and even occasioning a smarting sensation when applied to the skin of the hand , and its effect lasts two or three hours .	When heated , it readily melts , burns with a bright flame , and does not emit an ammoniacal odour .

It had a strong disagreeable odour , very similar to that of coal - gas ; it burned with a blue flame , slightly tinged with yellow : placed in an eudiometer , such as I formerly described * , and mixed with hydrogen , it underwent no alteration .	Two volumes of it , mnixed with one volume of oxygen , contracted one - sixth of the whole volume , and subsequently agitated with lime - water , contracted two - sixths more , lining the tube with a crust of carbonate of lime .

When C1 , poured upon pieces of melted nitre at the atmospheric temperature , an effervescence takes place with evolution of a colourless vapour which possesses in a striking degree the odour of aqua regia .	This vapour may be dissolved in various liquids , and when decomposed by water , yields nitric and hydrochloric acids .

The ' xcitorespiratory action of rum is probably not due to its volatile elements .

ro9735	fetor	of these waters							owing to mere stagnation		1 .	That the fetor of these waters is not owing to mere stagnation ; and that they possess something more than what common water acquires by putrefaction , appears not only from Dr .	Short ' s observation of some of these having a full and brisk current , but because putrid rain - water , and many of our chalybeat waters , turned putrid by keeping , do not discolour metals , as these waters do .

The effects of these waters , and their vapours , in discolouring metals , and their peculiar smell and flavour , like that of boiled eggs , and in the stronger like that of rotten eggs , are perfectly similar to those of the artificial solution of sulphur , and its vapours .	3 .
ro9735	smell		sulphureous						some experiments|burnt with a blue flame		6 .	That a real sulphur , or bituminoso - sulphureous substance , is dissolved in these waters , and subsists in some of their less volatile or more fixed parts , is evident from the following appearances in the mud and scum collected from several of them : for the mud of several of the cold waters I have called sulphureous , as well as that of several hot baths in Germany and Hungary , mentioned by Browne in his Travels , is variegated with the several colours of yellow , green , and red , as the real sulphur , and , in some experiments , burnt with a blue flame , and a sulphureous smell ; and the like evidences may be given of the sulphureous quality of the scum of divers of our cold waters , particularly in that of Mechan , in the north of Ireland , which , being dried , exhibited on the upper side a whitish yellow , or cream - colour ; but underneath a deep grass - green , a pale , beautiful gold - colour , and a light reddish pink - colour , interspersed in a substance of a leaden blackish colour ; every colour excellent in its kind , and as slippery as frogs spawn : varieties of colours , like these , being also found in the preparation of lac sulphuris variously exposed to the air .	But , to come to more direct proofs , we are assured , in Short ' s first volume of his History of mineral waters , as to the cold waters of Harrigate , that both the mud and scum burnt with a blue flame , and smelt strong of sulphur ; and that great quantities of yellow sublimed flowers of sulphur have been found under the basons of that well .

ro9735	stink	pellicles|which							being dried		Peter Shaw affirms , that real brimstone , even found to be so by proper trials , hath been seen floating in the water like feathers , and separable by bare straining : and to all this agrees the observation I have frequently made on several of these cold waters , viz .	certain light purple - coloured pellicles are frequently found floating in them , which , being dried , sparkle , flame , and stink , on the red - hot iron .	But , to conclude , the operation and effects of several of these our cold waters , altogether similar to those of sulphur , abundantly confirm their impregnation with that mineral .

Is the smell of the waters of Aix la Chapelle like that of the washings of a foul gun , or like that of the solution of sulphur in an alcaline lye ? So is that of our cold waters called sulphureous .	2 .
ro9735	fetor	sulphur|sea|water|the brinesprings|the chalybeate waters							by putrefaction		And , if this were further prosecuted , I doubt not but sulphur in substance might be obtained from several of them , as well as from Aix ; which is therefore recommended to physicians and naturalists .	So much may suffice concerning such waters , wherein sulphur is the predominating ingredient ; but there are others , wherein there are strong indications of its presence in a smaller proportion , and mixed with other minerals ; and indeed , perhaps , few waters are without an admixture of it ; for , beside several plain waters , especially such as contain the native alcali , and the purging waters , sea - water , the brinesprings , and the chalybeate waters , all which manifest a fetor by putrefaction , and some of them thereupon the like discolourations of metals as the sulphureous waters , the chalybeate waters , in particular , manifest a sulphureous admixture , by the cream , which they throw up to the surface , the various colours whereof , and its discolouring metals , are marks of sulphur .	There are , moreover , several other waters , even some of those , which otherwise make the nearest approach to pure element , having very little salts or earth , which I have mentioned in the beginning of this work , which also give strong suspicions of some degree of a sulphureous impregnation , by the purple and black sediments precipitated from them by solution of silver ; which are eminently confirmed by a late examination of the celebrated Holy wells at Malvern , published in the 50th volume of the Transactions , and there extolled for many cures ; which , altho ' they do not yield quite a grain of solid contents from a pint upon evaporation , give three evidences of sulphur .

And lastly , besides all these , I have frequently remarked of several other waters , here and there mentioned in this work , that their sediments , obtained by evaporation , did manifest some pittance of this mineral , by the fetor they acquired on being rubbed with salt of Tartar ; which , in the language of our author above - mentioned , being attracted by the acid , the phlogiston is let loose .

I have above recommended the farther investigation of sulphur as a desideratum in the history of mineral waters ; and shall now beg leave to conclude this paper with the mention of two or three more articles , which greatly want further elucidation .
ro9741	smelling						every Dog				What I would infer from this is , that Homer was certainly acquainted with the Madness of Dogs ; and if Dogs in his Days ran mad , it is probable they would bite Men , and if so , to be sure , an Hydrophobia would be the Consequence ; notwithstanding that , Plutarch will have it that it was first taken Notice of in the Days of Asclepiades , who was famous for his Practice in Rome before the Death of Mithridates .	Another strong Evidence of its Antiquity is that Instinct which directs every Dog to avoid him that is mad , upon smelling , seeing , or even hearing him .	If this is not Instinct , it is Reason ; and that in a higher Degree than we ourselves can pretend to .

In the Evening the Vapour emitted a disagreeable Smell ; and the Doctor happening to ride in the Rain , he perceived the Drops were of a maukish sweet Taste .	This same Phenomenon was of great Extent in the Northern Parts of Europe ; and at Kilkenny in Ireland , was seen somewhat like a Globe of Fire suspended in the Air for near the Space of an Hour ; which then bursting , spread Flames around on every Side .

After the observation which I have mentioned , it was scarcely doubtful that the product of the slow combustion of methylic alcohol contained the aldehyde of this alcohol in considerable proportion .
ro9753	odour		alliaceous						a current of sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through the methyl - alcoholic solution of methyl - aldehyde		The slight solubility and the powerfully crystalline tendencies of the sulphaldehyde of the ethyl series could not fail to indicate the direction in which I had a right to hope that the object which I was aiming at might be accomplished .	If a current of sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through the methyl - alcoholic solution of methyl - aldehyde , the liquid becomes turbid after a few minutes , and on allowing the saturated solution to stand for some hours , a body of an alliaceous odour begins to be separated at the bottom of the flask .	If the liquid be now mixed with half its volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid , and heated to ebullition , it becomes limpid , and solidifies on cooling into a mass of felted needles of dazzling whiteness .

As soon as the action ceases , the liquid is mixed with a slight excess of sulphide of potassium ; addition of water now separates a light yellowish limpid oil possessing a strong smell of garlic .	When rectified , this liquid becomes colourless , it boils at 140 ? C .

This substance acts with energy upon protoxide of mercury , with which it forms a compound , dissolving in boiling alcohol , and separating from it on cooling in the form of pearly scales of remarkable brilliancy , which present the greatest resemblance to the mercaptide of mercury .

The iodide contains C6 H15 C6 H r ) C6 3E5 On taking a retrospective glance at the results obtained in this inquiry , it is obvious that propylene , a homologue of olefiant gas , is susceptible of furnishing a mono - acid alcohol , which bears to it the same relation that is observed between methyl - alcohol and marshgas , or between benzoic alcohol and toluol , the analogue of marshgas among the derivatives of the aromatic acids .	The hydrocarbons homologous and analogous to marsh - gas , the homologues of olefiant gas , and indeed probably a very considerable number of other hydrocarbons , may be regarded as starting - points for the production of mono - acid alcohols and of all their derivatives .

His Lameness was occasioned by a Fever , which was translated into his Thigh , where it impostumated , and was afterwards opened ; but , not healing again , left Three or Four carious or fistulous Ulcers , which discharged a great Quantity of Sanies , and fetid Matter .	In this Condition he had been Six or Seven Years , before I was concerned for him , and was looked on as incurable ; this continual Discharge had reduced him almost to a Skeleton .
