ob148	smell	of liquor|of a drug									Q .	Was there any smell of liquor , or of a drug of any kind , about her ? A .	There was a peculiar smell , but it was not the smell of spirituous liquors â   I have no idea what it was the smell of ; it was nothing like chloroform , I think â   I have no reason to say that it was â   chloroform was mentioned when she made her statement to the house - surgeon at 10 o ' clock â   she did not mention chloroform before that â   she made some rambling statement before that , but nothing , as I said before , that I could make any sense out of till she said it to the surgeon â   she said something about a cab ; that was between the hours of 2 and 10 â   I cannot say exactly at what part of the time â   no one was present with her but myself that I remember â   she remained in the hospital five days â   she was gradually recovering from the stupor â   between 10 and 11 next day the house - surgeon gave her an emetic , and she was very sick â   she complained of headache â   she complained of headache before the emetic was given â   the smell was something like peppermint â   it was a peculiar smell , but I really could not take upon myself to say what smell it was â   I have frequently seen chloroform administered â   the length of time in which it takes effect is according to the strength it is given , according to what the patient will bear ; sometimes the effects will last till the next day â   it is sometimes necessary to repeat the application to continue the stupor if the patient does not take it well at first ; if the patient does take it well , it will last , I should say , about half an hour , or an hour , or not quite so long â   the stupor does not come on immediately on the application , sometimes in five minutes , sometimes in ten minutes ; some will take it much quicker than others â   I never saw an instance where chloroform was administered , and stupor came on in an hour or two afterwards â   I have been in the hospital very nearly two years â   she was in every appearance as a person would be were they in a state of intoxication , perfectly helpless and perfectly senseless â   as I said before , she gradually recovered ; and when she gradually recovered she complained of a severe headache â   that is not an uncommon consequence , either with chloroform or drink â   chloroform will leave the same effect , a sickness and headache - vomiting very frequently follows upon chloroform â   she did not vomit until after she had had an emetic , but complained of great sickness â   chloroform generally produces sickness without an emetic â   there are medical drugs that would produce stupor ; an overdose of laudanum would do so .

"On the night of 4th February I was passing 68 , Rhode Street , and saw the house on fire ; my attention was first called by seeing the window curtains alight , and almost momentarily there was a burst of flames â   I blew my whistle for assistance â   two men were standing at the opposite corner â   on blowing my whistle they ran towards me , one knocked at 70 , that was Whitehead ; the other assisted me to break the door open ; I have not seen him since â   I at once entered the house â   on going upstairs the first floor front room was burning fiercely , it was impossible to enter the room ; I went on my knees and closed the door â   someone holloaed , "" There are children in the house , policeman "" â   I went into the back room ; there was not a soul in the house â   by that time other constables arrived , and I sent them off to give the alarm â   there was a very strong smell of paraffin as soon as I entered the passage , also on the staircase â   I assisted in removing the goods in the two lower rooms â   about 12 ."	"15 I was there when the prisoner came home with his wife and two children , and a person he represented as his niece â   the inspector told him there had been a fire at his house , and that he wanted the particulars â   he answered , "" I can ' t help it , I did not set fire to it ; me and my family have been to a theatre "" â   he afterwards said to me , "" Where are the goods that have been removed from my house ? "" â   I showed him the goods , they were packed up in a garden at the opposite side of the street â   he said , "" Who gave you authority to move my goods ? I wish you had left them alone "" â   I saw nothing more of him ; the fire was put out , and I went away ."

He took from off my finger a topaz ring , with a brilliant on each side , and a mourning ring , and felt in my pocket , and said , d - n you , your watch , I said I had no watch ; then I pulled out a stone , and said , it is nothing but a stone which I carry in my pocket for the cramp , and took it out and shewed it him , he said , d - n you , put it into your pocket again ; he then took my buckles from my shoes , I am certain he was five minutes about me ; he felt in my pocket where was a snuff - box , I said it was but a very ordinary one , he said , then d - n you , keep it , then he went and robbed my wife .

On the Saturday afternoon before the fire there were two wine - bottles on that mantel - piece , one contained spirits of turpentine , and the other was empty ; the turpentine was in a full sized wine - bottle , and was full - it stood on its bottom ; I took it down and smelt it on the Saturday , and replaced it on its bottom , as it ought to be - it was corked ; I do not recollect whether I saw it on the Sunday , but I saw it on the Saturday afternoon - I went to bed on Sunday night as near twelve o ' clock as possible , and left master and mistress in their bed - room - he was then in the same dress as he had been working in in the morning ; Davis had not come in when I went to bed ; I had not seen him - I left a saucepan of clean water on the left hob of the kitchen grate , and the tea - kettle on the right hob , with some water in it , but not quite full - I left them so when I went to bed ; there was a very strong smell of turpentine on the stairs between ten and eleven o ' clock that evening , and I made a remark to my mistress about it .

Oh no , I am quite sure of that - when I went to bed on Sunday night I am positive there was not a particle of fire either in the kitchen or parlour grate ; there had been no fire in the parlour - I was awoke about six o ' clock on Monday morning , by an alarm of fire ; I got into Miss Twamley ' s front room , and there saw the Miss Twamley who has been burnt ; she was then alive , and in perfect health - I flew to the window , and jumped out into the street .

I belong to the Calais packet ; I am an officer of excise ; I was placed on board this ship between twelve and one in the morning of the 4th of May , I was alarmed by one of the officers crying out , which awaked me , and going to get up to get out of my cabin , I was stopped by a person who swore they would destroy me if I did not lay fast ; upon looking a little farther , I saw my brother officer , John Philpot , the man who cried out , engaged with another man , a tall man ; they demanded his money , and likewise the money of one Westgarth , an officer of the customs ; the man nearest me , that stood over me , then rummaged me , to see if I had a watch , or any money in my pocket , and when he found none , another that stood along side of him , asked him if he had spiced me , or some expression of that kind , he said he had , and that I had no money , and the other said to me , you lie , and with wicked expressions desired him to cut my head off ; upon that , he that rummaged me , shoved the other aside to keep him off ; then they asked me what was contained in those packages that were there ; I told them I imagined they contained cordials or perfumes , or something of that kind , but I could not tell ; they asked me then what was in the hold , I told them nothing but hampers of wine , I imagined , and cases of cordials ; they replied , that would not do for them ; they then asked if we had any candle ; we said we had none , it was all burned out ; upon which one of them took up the Custom - house book that I had to enter the account of the cargo in , and folded it up in two , and thrust it into the blaze of the fire that we had ; they then proceeded to taking out the cases or bales out of the ship ; the major part of them withdrew with the cases ; they then returned again ; I cannot say where they went ; they returned again , and upon the second look round them , they took up a small cask or keg , and they asked what was contained in that , and Mr .	John Philpot cried out , I believe it to be indigo ; upon which one of them said , that will just do for us ; then two of them came and shook hands with me as I lay in my cabin , and wished me a good night , at the same time threatened that if we turned out of our cabins , they should be back again soon , and they would blow our brains out ; going up the cabin , I heard one of them say to the mate , well , old fellow , if you have got any children , I hope they will not come to this that we are come to .

I was an officer on board the Calais packet , belonging to the Excise ; on the 4th of May , between the hours of twelve and one in the morning ; about ten minutes after twelve we were alarmed , by a boat coming along - side , which I supposed to be an excise - boat , as we are frequently visited in the night ; I was coming upon deck , and was met by a tall man with a pistol in his hand ; I took one of the cabin chairs up to keep the man from me , while I alarmed my brother officers ; I cried out , oh Lord , oh Lord ! turn out ; while my partner was waking , and turning out , one of them jumped up to the cabin where he was , and stopped him ; that was Smithiers that they prevented from jumping out ; the tall man that I met first , d - d me , and demanded my money , which I gave him , sixpence in silver , and two - pence farthing , I think there was , in copper , but twopence I am sure of ; then he gave me a blow with the but end of a pistol , to make me hold my noise ; I was begging for my life ; and he bid me go into my bed again ; I turned in , and one of them went to Smithiers , and demanded his money ; he told them he had none ; one of them made reply , cut his head off , a b - r ; he made reply , because I have no money , my friends ? and another that was in the gang , I believe , prevented him from doing mischief ; then they asked us what packages they were that were in the cabin ? we said it was impossible for us to tell , as we were only officers on board ; but we believed they were perfumery and smelling waters ; we could not tell .	Who was the man that prevented the mischief ? - I really believe the evidence was one , and that Romain was the other ; they took away three of the packages , and came down and asked me for a candle ; my friends , says I , we have no candle ; we have nothing more here than what you see ; the middle man , which I believe was Cunningham , took the King ' s book , in which the account of the cargo is entered , and crammed it into the fire to make a light , and it gave a great blaze ; then they went up with their packages ; they came down a second time , and asked me what was contained in the cag ; they asked us round ; I said , I believed it to be indigo , but could not tell ; they replied , they thought that would do , and went away .

John Philpot , who was upon the watch , and desired him to give him his money ; Philpot , when robbed , ran to the prosecutor ' s cabin , and I saw the same man demanding Westgarth ' s money ; the other two stood over me and asked what was in those cases ; I said , I believed they were cordials or perfumes ; then the three men took two cases or bales ; I looked at the three men as close as I possibly could , to see if I could form any idea of their persons ; I could not see their faces all of it ; I strove to observe ; they had handkerchiefs round their mouths , that was the reason ; I cannot say that Anderson was the person that robbed Westgarth , otherwise than he was a tall man ; he stood with his back to me ; with respect to Cunningham by statute and voice , he is the man that desired the other to cut my head off ; but I could not see his face ; I heard his voice at the Justice ' s .

I am foreman of the Western Fire Brigade , stationed at Ferdinand Street , Haverstock Hill â   I was called to a fire at 27 , Prince of Wales Crescent , on 21st January about half - past twelve or a quarter to one â   it was a very cold frosty night , the night before the rain froze â   I saw smoke come from the shop front , through the shutters ; one stream of smoke was coming all along the shutters , but it seemed to come out in two particular streams , one just over the fanlight , and the other at the further end of the shutters â   I was accompanied by two more firemen , Coutts and Keller â   I saw the constable Ford when I arrived there with the engine â   I went round to the back , in the court , with my hand - pump , and got over the wall into the yard of the house â   the other two firemen were with me , wo cut a hole through the window and shutter of the parlour on the ground floor â   I then looked through and saw fire burning under the counter , very slightly , that is , I saw flames coming from under the counter â   the door that divides the parlour and shop is half glass , and I saw through the glass â   I had the hand - pump and a pail of water with me â   I tried to open the shutters , but found I could not , from a bar being across them , and two of us burst open the yard door â   we went into the kitchen , and from the kitchen up the passage into the back parlour , and I commenced to work on the fire â   I should say this took up about a minuto or a minute and a half â   we burst the door open very quickly â   when I got into the back parlour the flames were still coming from under the counter â   they had increased very trifling â   Coutts went into the back parlour with me , he worked the hand - pump with a pail of water , and I crawled on my hands and knees towards the counter and played upon it â   we had opened the parlour door to get into the parlour from the passage , and we opened the door between the shop and parlour ; it was not locked , merely shut â   we had nearly exhausted the pail of water when we were driven back by a sudden flame which seemed to come all over the shop â   I can ' t tell what kind of flame it was â   I had to cover my eyes , the sulphur from it was so great , and run momently , I could not have stood it â   it smelt very much like tar , and the stench was very sickly when it was in my throat .

ob214	smell	a thick black smoke	tarry								Q .	Supposing there was a sudden turst of flame , a thick black smoke with a tarry smell , taking that in connection with the observations you made and the appearances you have described , what in your opinion was it caused by ? A .	The appearances , taken by themselves , show that a very large \ amountof combustible vapour was generated quickly , because it had forced its way in a most remarkable manner , which nothing but a sudden evolution could have done ; the whole of the windows were more or less covered with a sticky deposit , but in some of the windows this was sufficiently thick to be scraped off in the form of pitch , and in the kitchen the thickness of this pitch was considerable , and also on the window of the top front room ; the pitch had condensed on the inside of the upper sashes and had gone out through the crevice , and then been deposited on the upper part of the outside of the lower sashes ; the inference would be that while in a state of vapour it had condensed on the sash and got inside â   this is a piece of the glass of that window , taken out by Mr .
ob214	smell		entirely different								Are you of opinion that the burning of oilcloth or floorcloth would account for the appearances in the upper room ? A .	It is not only a matter of opinion , but I have no hesitation whatever in saying it would not , in no quantity â   if you get some unusual kind of oilcloth , I do not know what may happen , but I know very well the properties of ordinary oilcloth , and that wo found in the remains on the premises , and I have made experiments with it â   if it did contain something in the nature of oil of tar , it would depend upon the quantity and the time during which it was consumed , whether it would account for the appearances in the upper part of the house ; if a considerable quantity of india - rubber or gutta - percha were heated , it would boil and volatilise , and produce something that might be called in the nature of oil of tar â   I have made experiments upon this oilcloth in several ways â   I have burnt it â   when I burnt it in a particular way I was able to extract a resinous matter from it â   if you take a piece of it in a thin slip , and set fire to it , it burns with very considerable activity , and under those circumstances it produces very little soot , and practically no vapour â   at the same time , if you heat it in a mass or roll , by putting it on a fire or heating it with charcoal , it burns very little and it distils a great deal , but very slowly , and moreover in that case , where it only distils and does not burn , you have all the form of the oilcloth left , and more than half its weight remaining â   if you operate in a particular manner it is possible to get from this a something in the nature of oil of tar , but still a very different kind of substance from the deposit found upon these different articles ; in the first place , it is not so siccative , it does not dry up into a pitch - like mass , and the smell is entirely different â   you can make it pretty well any colour you like ; if you pistil it in such a manner that it shall be all distilled no soot is formed , and the substance is of a comparatively light colour ; if you partially distil and burn it you have a good deal of soot mixed up with it .

I am professor of chemistry at King ' s College â   I have been on these premises and seen the darkened substance on the walls and on the table - cloth , and the deposit on the windows â   the only way in which those appearances can be accounted for , in my judgment , is by the sudden combustion of some substance of a resinous or turpentine character , hydro - carbon â   tar oil would be of that kind â   tar oil has a very characteristic smell ; every one knows the smell of wood tar , it is something of that nature â   I smelt it distinctly when I went on the premises , in one of the rooms particularly there was a very strong smell of wood tar â   the slow combustion of oilcloth or india - rubber would not account for the appearances â   I took some things from the premises , here is a white china dish cover that was in the kitchen , it is so completely covered that I don ' t know whether there is any patterns on it ; this has been done by the volatilisation I speak of ; it was resting against the wall , and it is covered both before and behind with this volatilised matter â   here is a piece of the paper stripped from the wall in the passage ; it shows the kind of way in which this has come down â   this is from the lowest part near the floor , and from there to the top of the house it was completely stained in this manner â   this is not charring , but something deposited upon the paper and soaked and which I have afterwards been able to dissolve out and identify in as a tarry oily liquid â   this is a portion taken from the front bedroom at the top of the house ; it is completely blackened in the same way , not charred , but blackened by this deposit â   I have also , some pieces of glass â   this is a piece which was taken from the kitchen window , and on it there is a quantity of a black pitch - like deposit , which burns when it is scraped off ; it shows very much like pitch , it melts , and burns with a bright smoky flame â   the quantity of oil from which this vapour came must hare been considerable â   I don ' t know to what extent , it would be rather a guess to say , but about two gallons , or something like that ; I cannot tell â   front one to two gallons probably â   the appearances which the house presented were those of a sudden burst of flame , accompanied by a large quantity of some black tarry matter and vapour â   a great sweep of name had evidently gone up the staircase , the bulk of heat was most manifest at the bottom ; the marks of scorching and burning of the paint diminished as you went up ; the quantity of this black deposit was very considerable , and it was distributed through the house in the most remarkable manner â   in general the doors had been shut at the time , but the great expansion of the air produced by this burst had carried the smoke into the rooms and deposited it on the surface of the furniture , hangings , and upon almost everything ; it had been even forced into some of the drawers and stained some of the linen â   it had actually found its way into a cupboard and stained what was hanging there .

Wales had it â   the deposit on the paper and walls was carbon â   it was the deposit arising from the consumption of the floor cloth and table covering â   supposing a fire to have broken out in the shop , among the contents of which were floor cloth and table covering , which were burnt , the ascent of the smoke or smoky flame charged with that matter would be quite sufficient to account for the appearances in the upper part of the house â   I express that opinion with certainty , as far as a matter of opinion can be certainty â   I say it on my belief â   I took portions of the table covering and stair covering from the dÃ © bris in the shop , which we have in Court â   there was a large mass of dÃ © bris in the back room , but I did not find any burnt matter ; it consisted of part of the plate glass front , and the electro - plated tea and coffee service , melted â   it was collected together in the back room â   there was a large heap ; perhaps over a cart load â   I can hardly judge of the quantity â   it presented the appearance of a black burnt mass in minute fragments â   it was from that that I took this piece , of oilcloth ( produced ) â   this is a piece of the plate glass shop front â   you may see that some of it has fused , but this is not the fused part â   this is only from the severe contraction , the cold going on it from the fire - engine playing â   this piece of glass is not fused â   from the appearance presented by the plate glass , there must have been a very great \ amountof heat indeed â   this piece is not a sample of that which showed the most heat â   this piece ( produced ) shows me that there must have been a very large \ amountof heat in the internal part , and the body of water playing on the front caused the contraction you see â   there is nothing in this piece which can be called fused â   I picked these pieces of floor cloth out of the dÃ © bris of the shop â   the house was in charge of the fireman , and I signed a receipt for them â   I made experiments on the portions of the floor cloth I took away , and judge that they were made of paraffin oil or patent turpentine , boiled oil and dryers , sugar of lead , in the principal part of it , and that caused the \ amountof carbon to be deposited â   I came to the conclusion that there was either paraffin oil or patent turpentine in it , on account of the smell and the flame it evolved , and the appearance when it was burnt â   I examined the table covers â   their composition was similar â   the burning of a quantity of floor cloth and table covers , the matter being carried upwards in the smoky flame would , in my judgment , be sufficient to account for the appearances presented in the upper parts of the house ; it was all of the same character â   I examined the bottles and glasses , on which there was a deposit arising from burning wood â   a large quantity of wood had been burnt in the shop â   something in the nature of tar can be extracted from burnt wood â   that would also ascend in burning â   it is my opinion that the deposit was in the nature of tarry matter .

Odling has a tarry smell â   this appearance would certainly be produced by a sudden rush of vapour arising from the combustion of tar - oil â   I should expect to see the inside of the glass present a similar appearance to the outside â   I believe that such a combustion could arise from the burning of oilcloth â   it is simply a question of quantity .

I am professor of chemistry to Charing Cross Hospital Medical College , and have been so for four or five years â   I visited the premises 27 , Prince of Wales Crescent , on Monday , 1st April â   I examined the carpet â   I do not think I have a piece of it with me , but I have the extract which I took from it â   I observed a deposit on the carpet â   it seemed a black smoky sort of deposit , smelling somewhat tarry â   I took it to the hospital , and in the course of the following day or two I examined it as well as I could â   I took a square piece , where the deposit appeared thickest â   I boiled a small piece of the carpet with ether â   I then poured off the ether and evaporated the solution , and so obtained dryness â   I have the basin in which I performed the operation ; it has the residue in it â   there is a small yellow deposit on the evaporation , a some - what tarry or oily - looking substance â   I found that this was acid to test paper â   supposing a quantity of oil - cover and oilcloth had been burnt in the lower part of the house , to the best of my belief that would account for the deposit I found on the carpet â   I tore a piece of paper off the walls and took it home with me , but did not subject it to any special chemical examination â   I also found the deposit on the paper ; it was , however , of a different character and appearance at any rate ; it more resembled soot ; it was a very carbonaceous deposit â   I examined the glass of the pictures â   I removed one of the pictures , and have it here â   I observed what appeared to be a yellow oily substance on the glass â   I experimented on that by scraping off a portion of the deposit and boiling it with ether , and another portion with water â   the etheral solution or evaporation gave me a yellow oily substance very similar to the one obtained from the carpet â   the aqueous solution was acid â   I may state that both these yellow deposits appeared to resemble as closely as possible the yellow oily substance which is obtained during imperfect burning , the distillation , I ought perhaps rather to say , of wood and such like substances and fabrics ; paper for instance , linen , dresses , and so on â   I also examined a white jug , which is hero ; it is completely coated over with a kind of black shining deposit â   the deposit on the paper was dull , the deposit on this jug is something intermediate between the two other appearances â   on the paper I noticed a black opaque deposit , more like soot â   on the glass of the picture I noticed a yellow oily substance not in the I least like soot â   this seems to have the blackness of the one and something of the oily character of the other â   by burning oilcloth and oil - cover , I taken from the premises , I have produced results essentially identical with these three appearances â   a day or two ago I had submitted to me a small portion of the glass from the shop â   I have it here ; there is a black opaque tarry - looking deposit on it â   I made a small experiment with that within the last few days â   I boiled it with ether , and I found that it separated into two portions , a black powder apparently very like soot , and a liquid , which on evaporation gave me a yellow oil identical in appearance with that I obtained by the other processes â   that experiment confirms me in the idea of the black shining deposit being somewhat intermediate between the other two â   I have here the results of the experiments I made , and , if permitted , can show by burning a small piece of oilcloth the mode in which the deposit is produced â   in the first place , I burnt a piece of floor cloth , simply taking two or three thicknesses of it I together â   here is a portion of the oil - cover which I myself removed from the premises â   I only took three or four thicknesses â   I burnt it , and noticed that it burnt with a bright light , and with a very thick , smoky flame â   at a short distance above that flame I held this piece of white porcelain , and obtained immediately this deposit on it â   there is no particular smell from it , nothing at all in the nature of tar , I believe the burning was too complete for that â   I also made another experiment , in which I placed a piece of the substance folded up into a small crucible , such as I have here , in order to take the extreme of the opposite side â   in the first experiment I burnt the substance completely with a good supply of air â   in this case I did not burn it at all â   I simply subjected it to a distillation â   I heated it without contact with the air , and in that case I got on the upper portion of the crucible this yellow oily deposit , which is acid to test paper , and resembles closely in all respects the yellow deposit found on the glass of the picture â   I should be unable to distinguish between the two â   I made a third experiment , not , if I remember right , from the oilcloth , but from the floor cloth ; but in one case I made an experiment from the floor cloth which from an oversight I did not make from the oilcloth â   I first got a black soot deposited ; I then exposed it to the oily vapour attainable by the destructive distillation , trying to obtain the appearance I had got on the jug â   this is it â   of course I produced the effects rather roughly and imperfectly , but that is a shining black appearance , something like that I found on the jug â   I believe that was all the experiments I tried â   I certainly believe that the appearances I observed on the premises might all have been occasioned by the burning in the shop of a quantity of oilcloth and oil - covering , with a limited draught of air passing through â   supposing this table cover to be on the table of a room where the door was shut , and the smoky vapour getting through the crevices and settling on it , I should expect it would present this appearance â   I should be sorry 3to swear absolutely that it would , but I should expect it â   the tar - like smell on the rug seems to me to resemble very much the burning of wood and other fabrics â   I do not say it is identical â   a smell is a vague thing to swear to .

ob214	smell	a quantity of black soot|of vapour	suffocating								Q .	Supposing a moderate flame , confined to an area of three or four feet , and suddenly a burst of flame , a quantity of black soot , a suffocating smell of vapour , so that persons were obliged to rush out in consequence , should you be of opinion that that arose from the burning of oilcloth ? A .	All produced suddenly ! it seems very unlikely ; I can ' t pretend to say it is impossible , I should be very sorry to say so , I should be very sorry to say it was likely , it is not the phenomenon I should expect to see ; but I see a good many phenomena that I don ' t expect â   it is precisely consistent with the possibility of a flame reaching a vessel full of tar oil ; it is exactly the result that would follow assuming that it was an exceedingly cold night , I should think the appearance ! presented all over the house would be entirely consistent with it .
ob214	smell	tar							by the burning of the oilcloth and floor cloth		Did you see the dÃ © bris ? A .	I did â   I saw the remain ! of a quantity of oilcloth that was actually burnt â   I have some small piece with me that have been more or less burnt â   I saw some in rolls that had been partially burnt , one end of it or something of the sort ; the portion burnt off had been consumed ; I found it in the dÃ © bris ; the great bulk of it appeared to me to have been consumed : I found some remains â   it appeared to me that the portion that was not there had been completely consumed ; I could not say that whole rolls had not been consumed â   I heard some statement of the time the fire lasted , but I did not pay much attention to it , because it was not the point submitted to me â   I think they told me that it had lasted some hour or two , but I did not pay much attention â   I am sure that it did not last ten or twelve hours ; looking at the place was enough to show that â   a combustion might have been going on for some considerable time before the effects were visible in smoke issuing from the room ; one would fancy that the shop would first of all fill with dense vapour , which would afterward ascend â   I cannot say how long the fire would smoulder before smoke would come out â   I cannot say that oilcloth burning , and air suddenly admitted , would account for the sudden rush of flame and black smoke ; it might ; it is a question I feel some uncertainty about , not having any special knowledge to guide me â   the smell in the nature of tar might be accounted for by the burning of the oilcloth and floor cloth , provided they did burn â   it appears to me that might have caused all the appearances I saw â   I have no doubt that some quantity was burnt , because I saw it .	COURT .
ob214	smells|smell|smell	of the oil|of burning oil|of burning tar									I have heard the account given by the last gentleman , of the experiments he made and the results ; they are not at all inconsistent with my observations : we made substantially the same experiments , except that we used half - pound materials , but bringing out substantially the same results .	I scraped some portions from the wall and from other portions of the premises , and placed them through a rough analysis â   the results from the oilcloth do not alter the opinion I have expressed â   taking oilcloth and working it in different ways , you can get different results , but the product obtained by the different modes of treating oilcloth differs from the deposit in the house in several particulars â   the product obtained by the destructive distillation of the oilcloth is oil , and not tar ; it is a substance that is not siccative and does not dry up into a black pitch ; the substance produced by the distillation of oilcloth smells essentially of the oil ; it is the smell of burning oil , quite distinct from the smell of burning tar â   another point is that the distillation is an extremely slow process , whereas the distillation of tar takes place almost instantaneously â   it took us three hours to distil one half - pound of the material as we found it ; we took the roll rather thicker than my arm and cut a section out of it , and tried it with the piece of oilcloth as we found it in the premises , and it took us three hours to distil it , and half an hour to burn it on a strong fire , and it left half its weight in ash â   I do not mean that it took three hours before a product was obtained that would fasten on the walls and furniture ; the product began to be formed very soon after the heating , but it took that time to effect a complete distillation â   there is another point of less character , that the substance produced by the distillation of oilcloth has a very strongly acid reaction , whereas in the case of this deposit on the walls it was only just acid .	Q .
ob214	smell	by the oilcloth									Are you able to account for the appearances presented in the house by the combustion of any quantity of oilcloth whatever , in connection with any quantity of wood ? A .	If you take any particular part of the house , a portion of the wall or anything else , leaving out the consideration of smell , that appearance might no doubt be produced by the oilcloth ; but if you take the evidence of the sudden evolution of vapour , that could not be produced by oilcloth , because oilcloth will not produce vapour suddenly â   we extracted tar from the paper , and from some of the crockery , and from the glass of the windows , what every one would call tar .

"Brown , one of the matrons â   on Sunday , 24th January , about a quarter to 1 , I went to her cell , and found it full of smoke â   I asked her what was the matter â   she said , "" Nothing , "" and closed the door as quickly as possible â   I re - opened it , smelling , as I thought , something burning , and I went in and asked her what it was â   she said , "" Nothing "" â   I discovered in one corner of the cell , two candles lighted â   she said she was going to boil her cocoa â   I asked her to give me the candles , which she did â   I took them from her , and closed the cell â   it was my duty to make a report of this to the authorities of the prison , which I did on the Sunday evening â   on the Monday morning I went to the cell as usual , about half - past 7 , when I went round to serve the bread â   a prisoner of the name of Melvy carried the basket â   when I came to the prisoner ' s cell I opened it , and was in the act of stooping down to take out a loaf from the basket , when I felt my bonnet pulled off my head , and I received a blow on the top of my head , a second blow at the side of my left ear , and a third on the left cheek â   the prisoner ' s hands were then raised to give me a fourth blow , but I held her by the wrist â   I had two prisoners , Collett and Melvy , assisting me with the breakfasts , and they raised their hands as though they were going to assist me â   the prisoner said if any one assisted me , she would serve them as she had served me â   she said that I had reported her , and it should be the last I should ever report â   I saw something glittering in her hand at this time â   I bled from the head and face , and felt very faint from loss of blood â   I have since seen the bottle that was taken from her â   I did not see it taken from her ; I only saw something glittering â   it was a small substance held in a handkerchief , which was rolled round her hand â   I was taken to the infirmary , where I have been ever since â   I was in bed for fifteen days â   no one assisted me at all â   I managed to get away somehow â   Melvy went between me and the prisoner , so that I could manage to escape from her â   she threw the loaves of bread that remained in the basket at me as I walked along the corridor ."

"â   there was a diamond necklace among it â   with the exception of that necklace there was nothing in the parcel of any great value â   I think it was all paid for by cheque â   Cope gave me a turquoise necklet â   I have never seen the gold scent bottle â   I did not know the parcel was worth Â £ 486 â   I sold them for the price Cope asked for them I had a diamond and ruby ring â   the stones were taken out , I do not know if they were put back â   on November 8th I had a fleur - de - lys brooch â   there were no large stones in it â   it was sold for Â £ 16 â   it was not broken up â   a jeweller would take the stones out by cutting the little claws , when the stone would come out â   the brooch which I sold for Â £ 16 you could buy new for Â £ 30 or Â £ 40 , it is absurd to value it at Â £ 160 â   the fleur - de - lys brooch I took to Victor and Lidden ' s answered the description of Madame Dominquez ' except the value â   it did not contain large stones â   I never had more than one fleur - de - lys brooch â   when I took back Â £ 16 to Cope for the diamond brooch he handed me some loose pearls in an envelope â   I went and saw Victor and Lidden and asked them a price for them , I cannot remember how much â   I left them with Victor and Lidden to try and sell for Cope â   they were to give me an answer in the afternoon â   I am not know that they never bought those pearls for themselves â   I do not know that they got some money from Victor ' s father and mother â   I got the whole of the money at one time on that day , I can ' t remember how much â   on one occasion I received Â £ 280 â   I cannot say if that was the occasion â   I do not know if Â £ 280 was a fair price â   I am no judge of pearls â   I do not know that Victor and Lidden sold them to Schmidt â   these are cheques on November 10th for Â £ 50 , on the 11th one for Â £ 20 , and on the 15th one for Â £ 30 â   the whole of the money for the pearls was waiting for me at the office in cash when I went back in the afternoon â   I cannot account for those three cheques at all ; one of them is to myself and has nothing to do with Cope at all , two of them were paid to him â   I sold some diamonds to Victor and Lidden on November 10th â   I got about Â £ 30 for them â   I should think this cheque of November 10th would be for those diamonds â   I do not remember selling some more loose diamonds on the 13th â   I understood Cope got this second parcel from the member of the Eccentric Club also â   Victor and Lidden bought them without asking me where I got them â   the prisoner has not gone to sale rooms with me and bought things entirely on my judgment â   he has bought things with me â   I have only been to sale rooms on two occasions with him â   when I took goods to him he did not ask me if I thought they were worth the money or not â   I did not advise him to buy them â   I am not doing everything I can to shield myself and to put the blame off myself â   I complained very bitterly when sentence was passed upon me â   I did not sell the diamonds and other things to Victor on November 1st , 1900 â   we did not have a conversation , and Victor did not say , "" I had better make out the cheque as you are now in my employment "" â   it was not after Creighton ' s three months ' bill became due that I got the Â £ 15 commission â   Cope told me he had sold an emerald to a man named North in Leicester and got Â £ 5 for it â   I did not test the emeralds he threw over the bridge at Westminster â   you test emeralds with a file â   you can make imitations of glass or of doublet â   glass is not so good as doublet â   Cope asked me to sell a single - stone diamond ring , a half - hoop diamond ring , and a crescent brooch â   we went to several places â   we went to Attenborough ' s â   I went in â   Cope insisted upon having Â £ 100 for them â   Attenborough offered to exchange them for other stones â   they knew me â   we also went to Wilson Barrett ' s â   they knew me there too â   I asked them for Â £ 110 for the three things â   I came down Â £ 10 , and they gave me a cheque for Â £ 100 â   I asked Cope if I should accept the Â £ 100 , because he said he would give me anything over Â £ 100 â   he was waiting outside â   he said he would take Â £ 100 for them â   I cashed the cheque at the bank â   Cope gave me Â £ 5 â   I told my solicitor , Mr ."	Ayres , that I thought Cope was an excellent judge of stones , and had a good knowledge of weights , colour , and quality â   that is what I think now â   it is nut true that I told Cope that when I went to the Bank of England to change the gold into notes I had been taken into the private room , and that I wished I had never done it â   when I got Â £ 132 for the necklace the stones were taken out and weighed â   I think they weighed 19 1 / 2 carats â   I do met remember whether I sold some of the diamonds which came out of the gipsy rings , I may have â   I sold 20 pearls which I bought of Cope to Barrett for Â £ 30 â   that was about 30s .

The prosecutor described the pattern of the handkerchief before I shewed it him , he said he was a druggist it smelled of opium .	The gentleman went with me to the compter , he was well pleased that I had got the handkerchief , he wanted the handkerchief and to give me something for my trouble , I told him I could not let him have it .

ob306	smelt	the Family|Stench from the Excrement	prodigious				I				I never said any such Thing to you ; for I never said any such Thing to any Body .	Henry Gyles I live in the House with Mr Philpot ; I am a single Man , and lie in the Shop for Conveniency ; about Two o ' Clock in the Morning , on the fourth of last March , as I lay in Bed , I heard somebody knock at the Door , and presently I heard somebody come padding down Stairs , which I took to be a Man , and then I heard a Whispering and a rustling as I apprehended of a Woman ' s Cloaths , and I heard him go up Stairs again , and I thought , she had gone up too ; presently I heard something squeak , which I thought at first to be a Dog , and then I heard the crying of an Infant several Times : I wondered what could be the Reason of it ; this was in the Entry , and very soon after , I heard the Child cry at a greater Distance ; I could not tell whether it was above , or below , at first ; but afterwards , I found it was in the Cellar ; I wondered what she should do there , thinks I , she may take it into the Cellar to quiet it , because she will not distrub the Family ; by and by I smelt a prodigious Stench from the Excrement , and I did not get up , because I thought , if the Child was in the House of Office , I could not fetch it to Life ; some time afterwards ; I heard a Woman go up Stairs and draw Water , come down Stairs , and go up again : I was afraid to go out , to see what was the Matter , being a naked Man , for I had no Weapon to defend myself , and did not know , who might be there : About Five o ' Clock , I could just discern it Light , and then I went to Mr James ' s , a Cooper , and told him the Affair , and he came with me , and we searched the Necessary - House , with a long Staff with some Nails at the End of it : I advised her Father of it , and he said , he knew nothing of a Child , for he knew nothing of her Lying in ; but he was very willing if there was such a Thing , that it should be brought to a clear Light , and told me , he would enquire into it ; which accordingly he did , and she absolutely denied it ; he acquainted me with what had passed between them , and he went out about some Business ; she sent for me up Stairs , and began to be very robust with me , for aspersing her Character , and said , that she wondered what I meant by it , and the like ; and was in a violent Passion with me : I said , I would have the Necessary - House searched , and would not go to sleep till it was done .	I went for a Night - Man ; I think it was on the Friday , the first Step he took , he moved a Plank which I had moved before , and found nothing there at the first View ; then he viewed the Seat of the Necessary - House , and put down a long Fork , or Thing with Prongs , and brought up the Body of an Infant ; her Father was with me , when the Child was brought up , out of the Necessary - House .

ob353	snuff|snuff			snuff|snuff							Cowper had opened some of the windows ; there are three windows in the library ; they were all shut , and well secured on the over night with inside shutters ; by the partial light that was let in by some of the windows being open , I saw the writing - desk broke open ; there I kept my most valuable things I had in the house ; that was locked the preceding night ; the key was in my pocket in my bed - chamber ; I found the upper lock forced open ; there was another that drew out ; that lock had been picked ; the others were forced open ; in the inside of the upper drawer lay all these four keys that are here ; on the right - hand , one of these four keys was in the single press , of six presses under my book - case , where I kept any thing of consequence , which was the only one that contained any thing but books ; none of the other presses were locked ; every thing was thrown in the utmost confusion ; there was a great many manuscript sermons ; they were thrown about , most of them on the floor ; this red leather trunk was found quite empty ; it contained an egg trinket , which is the only article we can produce in court .	How lately before this robbery had you seen this trinket ? - Not perhaps since February ; I believe in the course of that month I think I must have seen it , for I had a mourning - ring there , that I would have wished to have tried on my finger , and it would not enter at all , having had the gout fixed on the joint of it ; I can charge my memory with having seen it in February ; there were three mourning - rings , and some other articles that have not been traced ; I immediately missed three snuff - boxes , one of them a very remarkable fine tortoise - shell , very large , with a picture ; I suppose it cost more than ten guineas , a great many years ago ; it might not be worth ten shillings now ; there was a varnished snuff - box , which I had bought when I was at Spa ; I had hardly used it ; it was in this leather case , in one of the pidgeon - holes ; the case was left empty ; I lost a fish - skin case of instruments , that was lying in my ink - standdish , that was on the library table ; a silver small pair of scissars , a knife , and other instruments were in that case ; in the upper part of that writing - desk there was usually two keys of padlocks ; they used to lay in a bit of paper together ; one of them I found in the morning , the other was taken away ; on the inside of the writing - desk there was a green varnish tooth pick case , with flowers of different colours , but the ground was green , and the pipe was what they call tortoise - shell , that was gone ; I lost three shirts ; going into my dressing - room , which is within my library , the window was close barred ; I opened that window , and found the lower part of an India cabinet was broke open ; in the upper part of that cabinet I kept papers ; there might be a surplice , I believe ; there was a glass door ; nothing appeared but papers ; I always kept all my linen in that lower part , and any body that lived in my house might know it ; the upper part of the cabinet , that contained papers , was locked ; I found these three keys laying on the carpet , immediately before that lock ; they had been taken out of the desk ; there were taken from that three shirts ; there were no more there .	Do you know the prisoner ? - Yes , to be sure ; he lived with me six months ; he entered into my service , by an almanack which I have here , on the 4th of April , 1786 , and was discharged the 30th of September , as appears by my memorandum - book ; I saw him once since , when he came and begged hard I would give him a character ; I think that was the only time I saw him ; I went into the water - closet between seven and eight in the morning ; it was locked ; there were three or four keys to it ; the key that lay in the standish had certainly been made use of , and that part of the house had been entered in the night - time , because in the morning , between seven and eight , I found that sash open ; there was no shutter or bar , or any thing ; I found the floor of the water - closet all wet , and the cistern that conveyed the water into the bason was emptied ; on pulling the string , there was no water came ; I was satisfied it had been emptied in the night - time , and they let all the water run in till the bason overflowed .

On Sunday morning , 24th March , about eight o ' clock , I was called to see the prisoner ' s wife â   I found her on a bed â   I examined her â   her head , neck , and face , were covered with contusions â   the face was amazingly swollen , and the features very much distorted â   she was perfectly insensible â   the entire scalp was contused â   it appeared to be a very dangerous case â   I apprehended fatal results from the first â   I visited her on the Sunday evening , two or three hours , and she continued completely insensible till the Monday , when she died â   I made a post mortem examination â   she died of compression of the brain , in my judgment , caused by extravasated blood under the dura mater â   the contused condition of the head , face , and neck , might produce rupture of the internal vessels and extravasation â   repeated blows from the open hand on the head would most decidedly cause the appearances I observed on the head â   the brain was remarkably healthy ; I have seldom seen so healthy a brain â   the liver was a little paler than usual , but plump and elastic , and so were all the abdominal viscera â   the paleness of the liver was probably produced when death took place â   the whole of the back was contused from the head to the lowest part â   those bruises did not conduce to the death â   I attribute it entirely to the bruises on the head â   the head was in a perfectly pulpy state ; there was extravasation of all the fluids under the integuments of the head â   on examining the viscera , I discovered not the slightest alcoholic smell â   the viscera did not present any appearance of a person given to drinking ; and that I might be perfectly certain of that , I inserted my head into the body ; so that had there been any effluvia from any alcoholic liquid of any kind I must have detected it ; and another thing , the liver of a drunkard is of so remarkable a character that it is impossible to mistake it â   it was certainly not the liver of a confirmed drunkard â   I made the examination on the Tuesday morning â   there was not the least smell of liquor in the interior .

ob361	smell	it			of coffee						On 17th April , I received from Mr .	Andrews , my assistant , a glass vessel â   I unsealed it â   it was completely secure â   it contained a brown - coloured liquid , very acid , about thirty ounces , a pint and a half â   I tested a portion of it â   it had the colour and smell of coffee diluted â   the acid element was vitriolic or sulphuric acid â   there was about half a tea - spoonfull of strong vitriolic acid in the thirty ounces â   taking into account that the coffee was not stirred up , I do not think there could have been appreciably more acid than I detected â   if a person had tasted the coffee it would be detected by the lips â   I tasted it , and detected it immediately â   there was a small quantity of sugar â   I applied all the tests for common poisons , but discovered no poison but sulphuric acid â   the cup would hold half a pint , and therefore , about a pint most have been added to it â   I received a bottle , a cake of soap , a coffee - pot , and a teaspoon â   the bottle appeared quite dry â   I examined it by a very delicate chemical process , and found it had contained sulphuric acid some time or other â   I tried it for oxalic acid , but it was not oxalic â   oxalic acid would be more likely to adhere to the sides of the bottle in a dry state â   if the bottle had contained oxalic acid , and vitriolic acid had been put into it , it would have removed the oxalic acid , and so have defeated the tests for oxalic acid â   I examined the coffee - pot ; it contained no trace of vitriolic acid , but when I warmed in it a small portion of the liquid , it immediately dissolved a small portion of iron from the pot , which was a consequence of its containing acid ; there was no iron in the original liquid which I put into the pot â   I examined the soap , but found no acid in it , except a small quantity combined with sulphate of soda ; but there was probably not the third part of a grain of soda in the thirty ounces â   what I found , could not account by any possibility for the acid in the coffee â   we find vitriolic acid in all soap , but in very small portions â   soap is made with common carbonate of soda , which is roughly made , and contains a little sulphate of soda , from which it is prepared originally â   the acid could not have been in the basin when Mr .	Hartley washed his hands , it would have prevented the soap dissolving ; in fact , it would have affected the fingers , and he must have discovered it â   if the soap had remained in the water all night , it would not have added to the quantity of vitriolic acid in the basin â   whether it came in with the coffee , or in any other way , I cannot say â   I am able to say it was mixed after the coffee was prepared and removed from the pot , or else added to the water in the basin â   I detected a small quantity of soda , but no more than would be accounted for by washing the hands with the quantity of soap dissolved in the liquid â   an adequate quantity of acid would have counteracted that â   I do not think the quantity of acid in the cup of coffee - would be sufficient to cause death â   a person might drink it , but the pain of doing so would be acute â   I ought to state , that the injurious action of vitriolic acid depends more upon its concentration than its quantity â   the proportion of vitriolic acid to the quantity of coffee , was 150 parts of coffee to one part of acid â   I have tasted that strength of acid myself â   a person would feel a dryness or parched state of the mouth , and a sharp sort of feeling of the teeth , which is called setting on edge , and if the whole contents of the cup had been swallowed , he would probably have suffered from vomiting , pain in the stomach , and soreness of the throat in swallowing , but I believe that in a few hours the whole of those symptoms would have disappeared , and he would have recovered without medical assistance , and without any injurious consequence ; in fact , the acid coffee was very little stronger than that which is sometimes given in an ordinary acid gargle â   it would not have the effect of destroying the surface of the mouth , but it would produce a whitish appearance by acting on the saliva â   I clipped my hands in it , and put it to my lips and tongue , and made my assistant taste it â   it would alarm a person , and so perhaps give him a stronger sensation of pain ; but the whole quantity would only occasion temporary uneasiness .

THE LORD CHIEF BARON was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible , if the same mode of treat - ment was pursued towards all the children , then the effect of that treatment upon the others became important , in relation to the cause of the death in question ) â   My opinion is that there was congestion of the brain in the other four children â   I was present at the post - mortem examination , and the congestion of the brain formed a very important part of the cause of death of those four infants â   I had noticed the condition of those children whilst living , and they all appeared to have been more or less subjected to the same influence as the infant that was entirely under my charge from the time of its removal , the kind of stupid condition , which led me to believe that narcotic had probably been also administered to them , as I was certain had been in this case â   I attribute the cause of their death to a want of suitable food , and probably also to the administration of narcotics â   when I went into the front kitchen , with Sergeant Relf , I noticed on the table a small phial , lying with the cork beside it â   this is it â   I marked it â   it contained a few drops of a fluid , which I was of opinion was laudanum â   I subsequently examined it more thoroughly , and I am certain it was laudanum â   I think it is tincture of opium , which is laudanum â   there were only about three drops in the bottle â   I don ' t think it was in a diluted state â   I think it was as it would be sold as laudanum â   after smelling the bottle , and handing it to Relf to smell also , I again asked Waters if she was quite sure she had not given the child anything to make it sleep â   she said she had not â   cleanliness is very important with a child , whether brought up by hand , or in the ordinary way â   this child was not kept well clean , under the arms and behind the ears , and generally it had not been well washed .

No , it would increase it â   drunken men vomit a good deal , and if there is bile it would be apt to come up with the beer â   I ascertained that he had vomited a good deal â   that would decrease his pulse â   when a man has been very tipsy over night , you do not expect to find his pulse strong in the morning â   I did not examine the room , but am certain he had no bottle of chloroform there â   the only trace of it I detected was the smell of his shirt â   chloroform is highly volatile , but I detected it in the folds of the shirt .

I went on the 18th to Cable Street where the fire was â   I had some difficulty in getting into the kitchen in consequence of the dense smoke arising from it â   when I did get in I found the greater part of the dresser was consumed â   the rest of the things right round the kitchen were burning at the same time â   the dresser was fixed to the wall in the usual way â   I cannot say exactly how it was fixed , but it was a fixture in the house â   I could not move it â   I tried â   there were lines lying in various parts of the kitchen as they had fallen , and parts were hanging to nails in the wall â   there was linen partly on the lines , and partly off , also burnt â   there was no fire in the grate â   there was a very strong smell of a spirit of some description , and gas escaping with it â   I should say from the smell that the spirit was most probably naphtha , but the mixture of gas made it doubtful â   it was very strong indeed â   nothing but spirit would cause such a dense smoke to arise â   the gas was turned on at the meter â   the pipe was melted â   the pipe comes down through the flooring , and along the ceiling â   that pipe had been pulled down â   the staples which held it were pulled out â   they must have been pulled out by some one â   I found no other aperture through which the gas could come , but that which was burnt â   the pipe had melted and fallen â   about a foot or a little more of the lead remained at the meter , and there the gas was coming through â   the effect of pulling down the pipe would be to bring it into immediate contact with the burning materials â   the window was closed â   there was no entrance to the kitchen but by the door â   after the fire was extinguished I noticed the quantity of goods on the premises â   I should say the value of the things when in a good state was not more than 7l .	or 8l .

Burgess ' s premises on previous occasions ; that is used for the manufacture of manure ; mixed with what I believe to be bone powder and coprolite powder , it forms a soluble manure , super phosphate of lime â   in March and April , when I visited the premises , I formed the opinion that mixing sulphuric acid and boiling bones would be a nuisance , but I did not see it , and therefore did not certify it as a nuisance â   it was in a latent condition â   there was no active operation going on â   if sulphuric acid was mixed with bone dust it would cause a nuisance , by giving off a suffocating vapour â   in consequence of directions I received , I went in May to the defendant ' s premises â   they were placed under my inspection by the vestry , in consequence of complaints which had been made â   I first went on the 11th ; or 12th , for it was at half past 1 o ' clock in the morning â   when I got within 200 yards of the place there was a light vapour coming in a direction from the premises â   it was a very fine night , and the atmosphere was very clear â   I was in a patent safety cab , and when within 200 yards of the premises the vapour became perceptible â   on reaching the premises there was a great noise ; the steam engine was at work , and vapour was all round me , clear and distinct â   the gate was closed â   on the eastern side there was not much smell , but on the western side ( the wind was coming towards the west ) the vapour came â   it produced with me difficulty of breathing and headache , and it was excessively offensive â   there was a vapour hanging over the ground for a considerable distance from the premises ; I saw it from the arches of the railway , and on the other side of the railway , the south side , the atmosphere was perfectly clear â   there was a great steam arising from a ditch , which I imagine to have been caused by the waste water of the steam engine â   the vapour was almost entirely on the western side â   it appeared to come from the erection close to the railway â   operations were going on there â   I experienced a peculiar metallic taste in my mouth ; I believe that to have arisen from the use of sulphuric acid ; that would produce headache â   the vapour gradually dispersed during the half hour I was there , and in dispersing , it became more diffused and less dense â   I did not at that time smell anything that I think arose from gas finings â   in my opinion the smell I smelt at that time would be injurious to health â   it was not a pleasant smell â   you could not enjoy life in that vapour â   the ditch round Mr .	Burgess ' s premises runs on the west , and a little to the south â   I did not perceive any smell arising from it at that time â   on 4th June I went to the premises again â   Mr .

Aldis accompanied me â   there was then a different smell â   the steaming process , the extracting of fat from the bones , was going on , and vapour was escaping from the building , which caused a very bad smell , just as there is from a bad cook ' s shop ; I do not know anything more sickening â   I do not think the defendant has had any fish there of late â   the vapour that escaped was from two chambers , called extractors or digesters , by means of the application of steam ; the defendant is a very skilful man , and he has made engines to extract fat from these bones , which have been cleaned beforehand , and during this process there is a sickening vapour given off â   the gas finings were at that time in a state from which there was not so much stench â   if it was wetted , and the sun came on it , there would be a very disagreeable smell ; it contains a quantity of sulphur ; it is what has been used for the purifying of gas â   I saw bones lying about in a semi - putrid condition ; the cartilage attached to them was wet â   I wanted to take away a sample of them , and of the gas refuse ; I asked Mr .

Burgess was very civil to me â   I was on the premises about an hour on 4th June ; the smell was different on that day to what it had been before , and I can swear that it was a different process â   I do not think it was acid that was being used â   I made this report ( handing it in ) the vapour on 12th May rolled over the market gardens , and no doubt contaminated the atmosphere â   I noticed on one occasion that the leaves of the fruit trees in the neighbourhood were shrivelled and scorched , and brown at the edges , whilst at some distance from the premises they are in a healthy condition â   I attribute the difference to the vapour on Mr .	Burgess ' s premises â   he has been on those premises for more than a year , for it is more than a year ago since I was ordered , under the Metropolitan Management Act , to inspect the premises with regard to fish .

"Burgess ' s â   I did not pass under the arches â   none of the persons suggested to me that I might go to the back or open part of the premises where there was no wall â   the vapour was not coming directly towards me , but more towards the market garden ground it left a metallic taste for some time , an astringent taste , acid and copper together , more like acetate of copper â   I think I was within seven or eight yards of it â   I am positive that I was not actually on the premises , but I was within seven or eight feet of them â   it was after waiting there some time that I discovered the metallic taste as well as the smell , and I said , "" I cannot stand this any longer "" â   I think the smell would come from sulphuric acid mixed with gas refuse ; there was gas refuse , and there were receptacles for sulphuric acid there â   Mr ."	Burgess refused me a sample of what I call the gas refuse , and therefore I could not ascertain what it is â   I had an opinion that it was oxide of iron purifier , but my notion is that there was some lime also , but I will not venture to swear it â   oxide of iron is used in the London gas manufactories to separate the sulphurous hydrogen from gas , in preference to lime , but it is objected to by Dr .

Burgess has in view , putrid bones would not do â   if the flesh on the bones becomes putrid , it acts on the bones also â   it is much better for the bone to get into the boiler as quickly as possible â   I have never seen any putrid bones on the premises ; there has not been any â   we have never boiled there above six times since the boiler has been built in the open part â   the last boiling was in the latter part of May ; I cannot recollect the day â   before that we had boiled two coppers in April â   I cannot tell the quantity that was boiled in May â   it was filled twice in April and four times in May â   it would take four or five hours to boil in the open air â   there was none before April â   the copper was never erected at all till the beginning of April â   the two fillings in April were on two different days , and the four boilings in May were on different days â   there was never any boiling bones before the copper was erected â   there were raw bones brought there before April â   I cannot exactly say what was the object in bringing them there â   I have brought a portion here of the bones boiled in May ( produced ) â   we have about two tons of bones there now perfectly free from flesh â   there have never been any horns brought there â   there has been slough â   this is some â   this is the way it comes on the premises â   there never was any animal matter , or flesh , or skins on them when they came on the premises , not the least â   these are what are called sloughs â   I do not know where those came from â   there have been fleshings brought on the premises â   they came in wet , all limed , and perfectly fresh â   the bullocks ' hides are limed by the tanners before they use them , and brought to us perfectly sweet â   the droppings from them are the lime water in which they have been put â   there is no animal matter or blood , not the least â   sulphuric acid is put on the bones to keep them â   the water will show a little green at the top if it abides a few days or a week â   that does not smell at all , except of the sulphuric acid â   it is essential for the purpose of making glue , that all the materials should be perfectly fresh , and clean , and sweet ; if not , you cannot make the glue â   that is the object of the lime water â   the boiler has been used six times â   that was not at night â   I always attend to it when it is used â   the gas refuse comes on the premises quite dry from the gas factory â   it lies in two or three heaps on the premises â   I cannot say what quantity there is â   this ( produced ) is the state in which it comes â   I cannot say whether there is any tar in it â   nothing is done with it at all ; it merely lies there â   there has never been any offal or entrails of animals brought on the premises , nor stinking carrion â   no carrion at all , nor flesh , nor animal matter , except what the butchers leave on the bones , and that comes perfectly fresh , and the glue pieces come in lime .

Burgess styles himself a glue and manure manufacturer , but we have never made glue on those premises â   the glue pieces consist of animal matter â   we should boil it if we were going to make glue â   we have brought fleshy pieces in a great many times , fifteen or twenty tons altogether â   we have sold it â   we never boiled any of that â   the fleshy matter is slips of sheep skins , and noses and ears , and portions of fleshy matter â   they have been all limed before they come to us â   they have been brought in waggons to our place â   they have lain there about three months before they have been sold â   twelve or fourteen tons at a time have been heaped up in stacks in the open air â   we never boiled any of them , we only boil bones â   we began to bring fresh bones in in December , 1856 , but we did not begin to boil till April â   from December till April we received somewhere about twenty tons of fresh bones , not more â   they were placed in a heap in the yard â   there had been complaints from the neighbours before April , of bad smells from our premises several times â   all those fresh bones have been boiled or steamed since April , part of them in the copper and part in the extractors â   we can boil seven or eight cwt .	in the copper â   we have only had six boilings in the copper and four in the tubes â   the tubes may contain about three tons each â   the bones remain in the tubes about thirty hours before they are let out â   they do not boil night and day â   we begin at 6 o ' clock and leave off at 6 the next morning , and go on that day and leave off in the middle of the next day â   we boiled three or four times in the copper in May â   we had about seventy tons of dry bones in since November â   they have been sold by ten or fifteen or twenty tons at a time â   I certainly did not tell Dr .

Challice that there was an unpleasant smell in removing those bones â   the complaints that were made were of the smells , not of putrid bones â   we had no putrid bones â   we had no horses ' legs putrified â   there was no such complaint made by Jennings or Armfield â   when we boil the bones we place them in tubs or vats in sulphuric acid â   when the bones come in they were placed in a heap , and day by day we saw them , and put them in a tub â   it takes about a day to saw a tub of bones â   the copper is circular , it is about four feet over â   I have seen a steam coming from it while the bones are boiling â   they take from two hours and a - half to three hours to boil â   there might be a little smell from it , but nothing offensive â   I have heard the neighbours say here that they have shut their doors and windows â   I never heard of it before this trial â   there is a pipe in the side of the extractors connected with the steam engine â   that engine is heated by a furnace â   I heard complaints of our premises last year , even when we were not at work , but we had bones and gas finings there â   I have heard all the evidence in this trial â   I am positive that there are no noxious or offensive smells coming from my master ' s premises â   I have heard the statements about shutting the doors and windows , it is not true â   this very morning Mrs .

Wagstaff , on 3rd June and 3rd July â   it differs altogether in it ' s nature from what is ordinarily called a bone boiling establishment â   I have seen a great number of them â   the bones are chiefly collected from rag shops and boiled in open coppers â   there are large accumulations of these bones , after they have been boiled with the gelatine contained in them , they are allowed to decompose â   they continue there a long time while this process is going on â   in bone boilers there are exhalations which cause uneasiness â   I looked at the copper on the furnace in the yard ; it was in the open yard ; it was not at work ; but I have seen the process frequently elsewhere â   it is boiling the long bones â   it is a very great object to put in the bones as fresh as possible â   assuming them to be placed in tube , diluting them with sulphuric acid keeps them in a fresh state for a considerable time â   the effect of boiling the long bones is not injurious , noxious , or unpleasant â   when you are near the boiler , there is a smell which I should compare to the smell of cooking â   if carried on as stated by the last few witnesses , it could not produce an injurious or unpleasant odour â   the long bones are the only ones that would pay the manufacturer â   I noticed the four extractors , they are to extract the gelatine and fat ; the bones are let out of the bottom â   there is an accumuation of fat which is let out into tubs â   that is a very excellent process â   open air boilers were formerly used â   if these extractors are worked properly , there cannot be any escape from them , and then there would be no smell â   I saw one at work , no smell came from it â   I found on the premises about a ton and a half of bones , and also bone black , that is , bones when they have been burnt , what is called animal charcoal ; and there was also about three tons of calcined white bones â   that was on 3rd July ; I found the same kind of thing there on June 3rd â   there would not and could not be any smell from calcined bones â   if you hold dry bones up to your nose you can smell them , but not in passing â   I saw about twenty bones that had been in the earth â   all the animal matter had been taken away , there was no unpleasant smell from them â   I found very few ordinary rag shop bones â   there were four or five tons of bones from which the animal matter had been removed in the extractors â   they were in a good condition , dry â   I saw some long bones that had been through the copper , they are used for knife and tooth brush handles â   there were some dry glue pieces , and some pieces drying on the ground â   they would emit an unpleasant smell if you held them to your nose , but not when walking on the premises â   I walked among them â   I found no animal matter but what I have spoken of ; no entrails , or anything that could be called offensive to persons on the premises â   the gas refuse was in large heaps â   partly under the new shed , and partly in the open air â   I examined a portion of it , it was spent oxide of iron â   they use that to purify the gas â   in doing that they remove certain stinking smells from the gas â   there is no unpleasant smell from those heaps as you walk along â   I put my stick to them , and could smell them then â   I saw some carboys , but did not examine them â   I looked at the coprolites â   they are used for making the super phosphate â   if it is made solely from coprolites , there is very little vapour ; but if from bones , especially bones containing animal matter , there is a considerable sour smell â   it is a smell which some of the witnesses have described as an acid taste â   that might arise from mixing up the materials , if done on a large scale â   I do not know that my attention has been called to the manufactories in the neighbourhood â   I have been to several japan manufactories where they japan leather ; sometimes there is a very suffocating acid smell from those , and sometimes rather a fishy smell , from using train oil or fish oil â   fumes of considerable volume might come from that â   I do not know that I have ever seen it in the night ; I have in the day â   I saw that there was a ditch with foul water â   I cannot say that it smelt until I got close to it and stirred it with a stick â   if steam water were thrown into the ditch , I should not think it would make much smell , independent of the temperature .

A .	Yes , he came to my house to request me to give evidence â   I found no smell that I consider objectionable â   the smells are merely from the mixing and the steam emitted from the steam engine â   no other except when I had the shovel full of oxide of iron â   that takes away the stinking part of the gas ; it neutralizes it â   that stinking part is not let off again from the oxide of iron .

For a week or ten days after the oxide of iron has been used for purifying the gas , does it not emit a most offensive smell ? A .	It does â   that smell may remain as much as a fortnight , but not longer , perhaps not beyond a week â   the oxide of iron is used for taking away the stinking part of the gas as much as it can â   it is rather a nasty , strong smell â   I should not object to live near 300 tons of gas ; I would rather live there than in a market gardener ' s ground â   it is not the dung that I object to , but the decomposed vegetable matter â   I do not say that I like twenty tons of raw bones , but I have no objection â   if they remained there , they would become objectionable , if they were in a raw state , and had animal matter attached to them â   the longer the accumulation of raw bones remained , the more strong would be the smell â   lying for a week in hot weather , they would become objectionable â   I think I saw about half a ton of raw bones , and about half a ton of wet bones â   that was on 22nd May â   I never saw twenty tons or wet bones â   I think I saw sixty or seventy tons of dry bones â   there were about twenty tons in a heap â   these produced are the sort called dry bones â   I mean to say that twenty tons of these , with the wet coming down on them , and then the sun , would emit no odour â   in this long bone there is nothing objectionable or injurious â   I could most decidedly hold this to my nose for five or ten minutes without being sick ; and if twenty tons of these dry bones were saturated with wet for hours , and then the sun shining on them , I can assure you there would be no smell â   in moving dry bones there would be just , but no smell â   there is a little smell at the time of moving the gas finings , but only in its own atmosphere â   there is a gaseous exhalation immediately in the atmosphere â   I was not present when any of the digestors were emptied â   there is not so much odour from these digestors when emptied as there would be from a leg of mutton , taking the difference of weight into consideration â   I should not like to live in that neighbourhood , on account of the ditches â   I should not like to live near any factory if I could help it , but I should have no objection to live near them in regard to it being not at all injurious to health â   it would not be agreeable , but there is no emission of any gas from that refuse except it is disturbed , and then only in its immediate part .

No â   I had no interest except to exercise my own judgment â   supposing the bones were in a heap , there would be an unpleasant smell , provided there were flesh adhering to them â   supposing they simply had the ends sawn off , and were placed in tanks with sulphuric acid , that would prevent any smell being emitted â   those I saw were about half a ton â   there was no unpleasant smell from them , they were quite fresh â   they come from the butchers , and they appeared to have been scraped pretty well before they came away â   I did not experience any disagreeable smell from the raw fresh bones in heaps or the bones in the tanks â   there were black bones , which came from the sugar refiner ' s .

Bones , and night soil , and other offensive matter , which we take particular pains to deodorize â   I can so deodorize night soil that I have given it to an inspector of police as snuff , and he has taken it â   I am a practical chemist â   I should think any person would , for his own profit , remove or consume such smells , if really exhaled , and I think it can be done â   I am aware of the method adopted for consuming smoke , and I think it the most suicidal Act ever invented , I have mentioned that to Lord Palmerston and Sir Benjaman Hall â   many of the varnish factories have an apparatus by which the steam and fumes from the linseed oil are entirely consumed .

I am a glue piece and hide merchant , and live at Brixton â   my business is carried on in Russell Street , and also in Long Lane â   I have seen the glue pieces which are frequently on the defendant ' s premises â   they do not make any disagreeable smell in the state in which they are , they are saturated with lime to preserve them â   that decidedly prevents the smell â   I have called there , on an average , twice a - week on business , for the last six months , but have not experienced any disagreeable smell on approaching the premises , nor when I got in ; there is , of course , a smell from the steam engine and from the mixing of manures , there is a little dust , but certainly nothing offensive â   I have been within half a dozen yards of the gas heaps , but never smelt anything from them â   I have seen a large heap of bones on several occasions , but they were dry ones â   I was present once when they were using the copper , there would be a vapour from it , but not at all annoying , and certainly not unhealthy â   I have seen the extractors at work , but never experienced anything offensive from them â   I know the nature of the process â   after the bones are steamed , there will be steam or vapour for a quarter of an hour , but it would be quite confined to the premises and not be offensive ; nothing remains but the lime of the bones when the fat is extracted â   the notion of their smelling less than a leg of mutton would , is the truth ; the smells in our kitchens are certainly not pleasant , but they are not unhealthy â   the fat being got rid of , there might be a smell while they were warm , but when they were dry there would be no smell .

Yes ; he asked me to look at her mouth â   I cannot remember whether he showed me the pieces of sheet first , but , to the best of my belief ; I saw her mouth first â   it was from the appearance of her mouth that I thought the linen might have been burned â   I think I might have seen the linen , because he had a bundle of linen in his hand as he came in , a sheet , or something of that sort â   I thought it was sulphuric acid from the appearance of her mouth â   there are some disorders which will produce white patches on the mouth , but not many â   the bowels being out of order would not produces them , though that might produce a very foul tongue and blisters in the mouth , but they would be a transparent white , and not an opaque white â   nothing would produce patches like that â   I know the disease called thrush , that sometimes appears in persons who are in a very low state of health â   they have patches on the mouth â   if a person has been greatly suffering from diarrhea , so that the stomach becomes lowered , thrush may ensue â   sulphuric acid is colourless , and has no smell when pure â   when it is thrown on anything , it smells â   when thrown on linen , it decomposes it , and there is a sour smell â   the linen brought to me smelt , not of black draught , but of sulphuric acid â   I did not examine the whole of the sheets â   a piece of a sheet was brought to me , and I saw the remainder of it before the Magistrate â   my opinion is that the inspector brought the whole sheet , and I took a portion of it , but it might not be so â   it was in pieces , because it was rotten â   I had never seen Mrs .	Carnell before â   besides sulphuric acid , there are a hundred things that would produce spots of rust on iron , all the mineral acids â   I did not apply any test to those spots ; they were of a grayish white .

"Catlin , this is a serious matter "" â   he replied "" She set herself on fire on Tuesday ; I threw two pails of water over her , and she died on Wednesday "" â   I then unlocked the front door and called the police , and the prisoner was removed â   I at once proceeded to examine the state of the body ; it was in an advanced state of decomposition , and was crawling with large vermin â   in my opinion she had been dead at least from five to six days â   there was a rag wrapped round the left foot , which had apparently been soaked with oil â   the foot was extensively burnt â   I made a post - mortem examination next day , Wednesday , the 14th â   the face on the right side was scorched â   the fingers of the right hand were severely burnt ; the left side of the abdomen was severely burnt , also the whole of the right thigh and leg down to the foot â   the left foot was burnt , and the left leg and thigh on the outside ; there was no burning on the front of the chest , but at the posterior â   the natis and the greater part of the trunk , particularly on the left side , was severely burnt â   I found large bruise on the right temple ; the bruises were not very old â   they extended through the skin to the bone , but the bone was not discoloured ; there was another bruise close to the shoulder , another one close to the right nipple , and another on the left side above the hip â   the right arm was slightly bruised , but hardly worth mentioning â   on opening the brain I found it congested with its membranes â   I did not trace the appearances of her having been addicted to excessive drinking , but a person might drink for years without showing any indication of it â   the body was well nourished ; she was a very fine woman ; the organs were all healthy ; I should think she was about 45 years of age â   the cause of death was depression of the nervous system , congestion of the internal organs , and probably coma â   the extent to which the body was burnt would produce the shock to the nervous system ; the extent of the burning would produce the symptoms I found â   the bruises had nothing whatever to do with the cause of death â   the burning ought to have received immediate medical treatment â   extensive destruction by burning the skin is dangerous â   if she had not medical treatment she would get worse by degrees â   she would fall into this state of congestion in which the organs were within 48 hours â   I think had medical aid been procured within the first 24 hours her life would have been spared ; at all events prolonged â   I have seen cases more extensively burnt recover â   in my opinion , even at the end of 48 hours medical aid would have tended to prolong life , but it would not have given such a good prognosis of the case â   there would have been a probability or a chance of prolonging life â   the clothing on the body was not all burnt â   she could have sustained the injuries while those clothes were on her ; they must have been put on afterwards ; I saw some burnt clothing , found a portion of charred fabric in the kitchen , pieces of black burnt fabric , the flounce of a petticoat , and pieces of burnt fabric all over the house upstairs â   I examined the house â   it was in a very dirty and bad condition , particularly the two front bedrooms upstairs and one of the back bedrooms â   the beds , bedding , and bedclothes were all covered with human excrement ; the carpet was all smeared , you could hardly step , and part of the dressing - table and the washstand â   I did not see any excrement in the downstairs rooms â   there was a quantity of decomposed food in the pantry ."

I live at 29 , Bee Cottages , Hanworth â   on 5th July the prisoner came to Smith â   he asked for the keys of 35 and 38 sheds â   Bushell was there â   he did not have the keys â   he followed Smith across to 35 shed â   I afterwards saw him come from the shed to the receiving room with a lighted lamp in his hand , he had nothing else â   I did not see where he went with the lamp â   I saw him hang up his keys when he had locked up his own place , that was about half - past ten â   they were keys of the finishing - room and the packing - room ; he wished me good night ; I was then in the clerk ' s office â   after that I went out with Bushell and Smith â   shortly after we got out I noticed a light upstairs ; I went back with the others ; I got water and helped to extinguish the fire on the sacks â   I first noticed the straw right underneath the sacks in one corner â   the fire had originated at the bottom where the straw was â   I waited there all that night with the other witnesses â   I went into 35 and saw the lamp partly turned down â   between three and four the following morning I went into the room 27 where the drawer was â   there was a smell of burning â   it was partly open , not quite pulled open , till the police came â   I cannot at all understand what the prisoner means by the statement that I had been working against him to get him out â   I had not been doing so â   on this night of July 5th I had been smoking a cigarette at the mess - room door , that was just after ten ; that was after the women had gone â   I had not been into the gallery at all that day , nor in 27 .

It does not look so bright â   the colour would not be altered materially without it was packed very hot , and that they would never do â   I can hardly say how it would look if it was packed very hot â   such a thing is hardly ever done with good meat â   if it got overheated from warm weather , it would become green and tainted â   I saw nothing of that sort here â   there was nothing at all of taint â   if meat becomes tainted or putrid it has a smell â   there was none here â   the fleshy part of the meat was wet as well as the other â   if there is disease that wetness would go on increasing the longer it .	is kept â   it must have been coming on for some considerable time ; I can ' t form an idea how long ; far beyond twenty - four hours â   I should think the wetness would exist in the animal when living â   in animals of that kind the carcase never gets stiff â   the fat never gets set â   the wetness is a consequence of disease , I should think , while the animal was living â   the wetness , which is indicative of disease , would exist in the animal when alive , if it was diseased â   I went to the shop of Messrs .

ob567	putrid|putrid|smell	bar tainted meat	putrid|putrid								Q .	Just explain what is the character of putrid bar tainted meat ; is it a discolouration or smell ? A .	Yes ; there are two things , first , the appearance of it , it is flabby , and it becomes darker coloured â   those are the two appearances , and it evolves an unpleasant door , varying from what we call taint merely , up to actual putrefaction â   I infer from the appearances I saw on the pleura the existence of disease to a considerable extent , if not of long standing â   if I had not seen the pleura at all , I should have said that it was a diseased animal â   I could not have said what the disease was ; but seeing the pleura affected , I could also say , not only it was diseased , but the character of that disease â   I could tell , without the indications of the pleura , that it was diseased , as distinguished from taint â   the appearances I saw must have existed some time before death , for this reason , that the tissue of the animal was degenerated ; a thing that cannot happen after death ; it must have arisen from disease before death â   the muscular tissue of a sound animal is firm , dark coloured , well set ; that is a condition of health â   in disease we find the fibre of the muscles to be weak , never contracting or becoming rigid , and it is infiltrated with the serum infused into it during life ; and it is therefore gelatinous and flabby , and pale coloured , which is never the character of putrefaction â   that arises from disease in life â   in other words these are vital appearances , not post - mortem appearances â   they require some vital power to set up and go on , and when the vital power ceases they remain â   I think it impossible for a butcher to have had his attention directed to it , if he had any experience whatever , without being at once satisfied that there was disease â   I now speak of the flesh of the animal , without regard to the tissue â   looking at the fleshy part of the animal , there must have been such an indication of disease as a good butcher , with an opportunity of examination , would discover it â   I think so decidedly ; there is no doubt about it .
ob567	putrid|putrid	meat	putrid|putrid						from hot weather		Q .	If meat becomes tainted or putrid from bad packing , or from hot weather , what is the appearance it usually presents ? A .

I went immediately â   the Volunteer Fire Brigade had arrived at that time , and had been pumping with a portable hydrant â   I went in at the street - door , and went first into the taproom â   I observed a considerable quantity of shavings on the floor of that room â   they were smouldering in two distinct places â   there was a very strong smell of paraffin â   I at once took up the shavings and smelt them ; they smelt of paraffin of some description â   I should say there had been a great quantity of paraffin upon them â   they were wet , but , of course , water had been poured upon them as well â   I examined all the shavings in different parts of the room , and they all smelt of paraffin â   the wooden partition had streams of wet oil in one or two places â   I put my hand on it , and drew the oil from it â   that was a boarding against the wall , 4 or 5 feet high â   there were settles attached to the walls , and the greater part of them were covered with paraffin , and some had splashed on to the sawdust â   there was also a quantity of paraffin on the table , and a large empty sack was nearly half saturated with it â   there was nearly a sackful of shavings about the room , and many of them were burnt â   the door between the taproom and bar being shut , there was no draught â   the wooden panellings in the corner behind the tap - room door were considerably burnt ; they had most certainly blazed â   I then went into the cellar â   there had been more fire there by a great deal than there had been in the taproom â   there were consumed shavings on the floor ; some partly burnt , and some not burnt â   they were principally in the back cellar , the spirit cellar , immediately under the taproom â   there is a funnel - hole about the size of a crown - piece communicating between the cellar and taproom , for the purpose of pouring ' spirits down â   the taproom floor forms the ceiling of the cellar ; it is only flooring , joisting â   by the quantity consumed , I should say there were more shavings in the cellar than in the taproom ; there would be at least a sackful â   the staircase or passage , about 8 or 10 feet in length , leading from the ground floor to the cellar was else strewn with shavings â   there was a smell of paraffin in the cellar , but not quite so strong as in the taproom â   the ceiling was charred , but not to a great extent â   the cellar is about 6 1 / 2 feet in height â   on one of the casks , which was lying on its belly , there was a mound of sawdust and burnt shavings deeply saturated with paraffin , that was nearly consumed â   I found an empty two - gallon stone bottle in the cellar which smelt very strongly of paraffin â   I poured some into my hand ; there were three or four table - spoonsful of paraffin , or a little more , left in the bottom â   I should say there had been two distinct fires in the taproom , but not enough to clearly swear by , and one fire in the cellar distinct from the taproom fire â   I am quite sure of that â   I saw the prisoner shortly afterwards next door â   I told him that the circumstances were very curious , and asked if he had had any repairs done lately , or could he in any manner account for the shavings â   he made no reply at first , but he ultimately said , within a minute or two , that he had carried some through the previous evening into the back place , and he might have dropped some â   I called his attention to the shavings more particularly in the taproom â   he said he could not account for them â   I asked who was the last in the place â   he said he was â   I think he said he went to bed about 1 o ' clock â   I took a cursory view of the stock ; I did not see closely into it â   I saw that all the spirit casks were empty ; I should say there were about eight or nine in the cellar â   the one on which the little mound had been was charred â   I went up stairs with the inspector and the prisoner ; he accompanied us through the house â   a bed was pointed out to me in the front room second floor â   the prisoner said that was his bed where he had slept , and a person drew my attention to the fact that only one person had lain in it â   I noticed only the impression of one person â   I put my fist on the bed to see if it was one â   that would give an impression of a person lying on it , and my fist went into it ; it was an ordinary soft bed â   I told the prisoner the facts did not look as if he had slept there â   he made no reply that I know of â   I saw a cask standing on its top in the cellar â   it is a mistake of the last witness ; it was not paraffin on that , it was water that had flowed down the funnel - hole ; it was exactly under the hole â   there was no paraffin among it that I could perceive .

Bridges , and then came up again to the same room â   the prisoner and his wife were then both on the bed , at least his wife was lying on the bed , and he was leaning half on and half off the bed â   I told him that everything was very suspicious , and as he could give no account as to how the fire originated , I considered it my duty to take him into custody for wilfully setting fire to the house , there being other persons therein at the time â   he made no reply â   he took the policy of insurance out of his coat pocket , and handed it to his wife , and I took charge of it â   I produce it .

Lippy described , because I saw her at one o ' clock , and the injuries appeared to be more recent than if done at ten or eleven â   a kick on the forehead would cause the injury â   I have attended her since ; I think she will recover , but I cannot speak positively , because the remote results of brain injuries are so uncertain â   I could not smell any liquor about her ; she was stupid and dazed , but the injury to the head was sufficient to account for that , and I cannot say what it was due to â   the prisoner appeared to be sober â   as he was going to the station I heard him say he hoped he might hang for her â   these cases used to be regarded as fatal , but lately there have been one or two recoveries from them â   the injury might have been caused by a fall from a height on to a projecting point like a cobble stone , or by the person being lifted up and banged down , but not by an ordinary fall .
