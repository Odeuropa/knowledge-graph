obc68	smell	of the gas			George ' s - in - the - East , and other districts — I have bad considerable practical experience in the preparation of condensed milk — when tins of condensed milk are blown it indicates that fermentation of the contents has taken place — I could not say from that alone whether the contents were or were not fit for human food — it would not be safe to use the milk if the tin was blown — when a blown tin is punctured the gas which is causing the bulging escapes , and from the smell of the gas you can tell whether the contents are good or bad — I did not see these tins — in a suitable temperature of between 60 ° and 70 ° F .

obc68	smell		peculiar		I am the medical officer at Her Majesty ' s Prison , Holloway — the prisoner first came under my observation on January 18th — I have had him in the hospital ever since , and have examined him very frequently — all the time he has been under my observation he has complained of pains in his head — he has slept very badly at night ; the pupils of his eyes have been unequal , and he has had Hallucinations of hearing — the first three weeks in the hospital he fancied he heard voices at night calling him — he used to describe what they said — for the past fortnight those voices have disappeared , and his mental condition seems to have slightly improved — he had undoubted delusions — he stated to me that Chester , whom he stabbed , he considered was employing a gang of men and paying them to annoy him , and that these men had gone to the lodgings where he lived and made statements about horrible conduct he had been guilty of to his wife , and daughter , and mother - in - law , and also made attempts to poison him , and had put ether into his room to stupefy him , and put poison into the food he took on two or three occasions , and that he had overheard certain observations which had been made by a man who was speaking to Chester , that led him to believe that the gang was in the pay of Chester — he said he could tell these men had been attempting to poison him by a peculiar sensation that came over him ; he had lost power in his legs , and become giddy , and a peculiar smell , like that of rotten onions , came into his nose — from my observation and examination of him I consider he is at the present time decidedly insane — I examined him yesterday , and all the delusions he had when I first examined him still exist with regard to his persecution — I should say he was not sane on 17th January , and that he was unaccountable for his actions — I thought he was capable of understanding this trial .
obc68	smelt|smell		very badly|very sour		apiece — Porter opened two for me — I did not select the tins ; he picked them up himself — the whole lot were bulged at the ends — the milk in the two opened by Porter appeared a very dirty yellow colour and smelt very badly ; it was a very sour smell — when he punctured the tin gas blew out — I examined the whole of the fifty - nine tins and told him I should seize them as being unfit for food ; and I seized and took them to Dr .
obc68	odour		offensive|offensive		Baggallay , and I saw them opened in his presence — in all the tins I saw opened the milk was thick , of darkish colour , in place apparently curdled , and with an offensive odour — when the tins were opened an offensive gas escaped — in my opinion that milk was quite unfit for human food — a robust individual might get over taking it ; a person a little out of sorts would probably get indigestion from it or some gastric or internal irritation ; it might be very dangerous to children , and it is largely used for young children ' s food — it would be harmful to infants and adults .

obc147	smell	the plant			I am a bachelor of medicine , of the London University , and practice medicine at the hospital — I know that lobelia is given by medical persons , and in cases of asthma — it is given is cases which I think imprudent , unless the system has become accustomed to it , there is not then so much harm done — this 110 grains is a sort of husk of the wood , like the grains of malt , which has had all the goodness or badness taken out of it , and is not digestible in a weak stomach — such a thing night happen as its remaining in the stomach from day to day , or it might pass out into the alimentary canal — I cannot say how long it would take , as such a difference of opinion exists — all the quality has been got out of it in the stomach by maceration ; that is , assuming that none of the quality had been got out of it before it got into the stomach , which I cannot tell — I found a mere inert matter , not capable of digestion in a weak stomach — if it went into the stomach in an active state , it most have remained there long enough for the liquid to dissolve all the active principle in it — the question how long that would take , has matter of scientific opinion involved in it ; some physicians believe digestion to take three or four hours , and others believe that there are circumstances existing under which it has not taken place under twenty - four hours , and you have all kinds of opinions between the four and the twenty - four — I will not venture to offer an opinion at all ; if the stomach is weak , it may still have the power of dissolving vegetable matter — sometimes a weak stomach would dissolve the seed quicker than a strong one — I should think that this was a very weak stomach — such a thing might happen , that the stomach of a person just going to die would dissolve anything much quicker than that of a robust one — I have known digestion take place after death — this is the seed of lobelia ; the plant has been raised in this country ; it is grown as a common plant in our gardens ; it has a little blue flower , and is cultivated for its beauty in almost every garden — it is a natural family — Linnaeus would have called it a class ; a genus is a subdivision of a natural family — tobacco is not of that family — here are some seeds from the stomach ( produced ) the plant itself has much less smell than the seeds usually have — the seeds contain more of the active principle than the leaves , although they have not a smell — lobelia , in combination with an acid has no smell , it keeps its odour down — the active principle of this plant is an alkali , and until the alkali is set free by another acid , you cannot smell the lobelia — tincture of lobelia has a smell , the acid sets the smell free — some doctors fancy the ethereal tincture of lobelia ; I like it , and give a good deal of it — I think lobelia a very excellent medicine in its proper place — I should give from five to twenty drops , made with ether or spirits ; we make both of the same strength .

obc80	smelt|smell	boxes|of burnt wood			Becker , the manager of the Western Insurance Office — I examined the shop more minutely as soon as we could clear the rubbish away ; that was about the next day , the second day after the fire — I examined the remains of the counter , it is here — this ( produced ) is a portion of it — there is some more in a van outside ; this is the top of the counter , and here is the underneath part of it , the part that was burnt — the upper portion is not burnt — there is a bit of the cloth on it now — it is printed calico — the remains of the counter which is outside is like this , burnt inside , but not out — I saw some boxes which were found by my firemen in the shop — this ( produced ) is one of them ; that is burnt inside , and not out — there were two other boxes larger than this they are here , — they are more burnt — I saw them on the premises the next day after the fire , but not to take any particular notice of them till the fireman called my attention to them , about the second day after — I smelt the boxes at that time , I could not perceive any smell in them , only of burnt wood — this is the remains of the other box — they got broken in turning over the ruins — this is the third box — there are two big ones and a small one — these are the whole of the three boxes — I examined the state of the shop floor the day after the fire , but not so minutely as I did the day after , and since that — I examined the part where I first observed the fire when looking through the hole in the shutter — I found a hole burnt in the floor where , as near as I can remember , I first saw the fire ; it was burnt completely through , and I saw another hole from two to three feet nearer towards where I was kneeling when I first went in , nearer the parlour door — I found several smaller holes , some about five inches in diameter — the holes under the counter were , I should say , about eighteen inches by fourteen , I never measured them — one was a little larger than the other — the one nearer the parlour door was the largest — there was one hole under the show board of the window ; that was about nine inches across — on clearing away the rubbish of the shop I found the floor was burnt all over , as if something had run all over the floor alight ; we saw that when we came to sweep the floor up — we did not discern that while the rubbish was lying about .

obc80	smell		tarry		Supposing there was a sudden turst of flame , a thick black smoke with a tarry smell , taking that in connection with the observations you made and the appearances you have described , what in your opinion was it caused by ? A .
obc80	smell		entirely different		It is not only a matter of opinion , but I have no hesitation whatever in saying it would not , in no quantity — if you get some unusual kind of oilcloth , I do not know what may happen , but I know very well the properties of ordinary oilcloth , and that wo found in the remains on the premises , and I have made experiments with it — if it did contain something in the nature of oil of tar , it would depend upon the quantity and the time during which it was consumed , whether it would account for the appearances in the upper part of the house ; if a considerable quantity of india - rubber or gutta - percha were heated , it would boil and volatilise , and produce something that might be called in the nature of oil of tar — I have made experiments upon this oilcloth in several ways — I have burnt it — when I burnt it in a particular way I was able to extract a resinous matter from it — if you take a piece of it in a thin slip , and set fire to it , it burns with very considerable activity , and under those circumstances it produces very little soot , and practically no vapour — at the same time , if you heat it in a mass or roll , by putting it on a fire or heating it with charcoal , it burns very little and it distils a great deal , but very slowly , and moreover in that case , where it only distils and does not burn , you have all the form of the oilcloth left , and more than half its weight remaining — if you operate in a particular manner it is possible to get from this a something in the nature of oil of tar , but still a very different kind of substance from the deposit found upon these different articles ; in the first place , it is not so siccative , it does not dry up into a pitch - like mass , and the smell is entirely different — you can make it pretty well any colour you like ; if you pistil it in such a manner that it shall be all distilled no soot is formed , and the substance is of a comparatively light colour ; if you partially distil and burn it you have a good deal of soot mixed up with it .

obc80	smelling		somewhat tarry		I am professor of chemistry to Charing Cross Hospital Medical College , and have been so for four or five years — I visited the premises 27 , Prince of Wales Crescent , on Monday , 1st April — I examined the carpet — I do not think I have a piece of it with me , but I have the extract which I took from it — I observed a deposit on the carpet — it seemed a black smoky sort of deposit , smelling somewhat tarry — I took it to the hospital , and in the course of the following day or two I examined it as well as I could — I took a square piece , where the deposit appeared thickest — I boiled a small piece of the carpet with ether — I then poured off the ether and evaporated the solution , and so obtained dryness — I have the basin in which I performed the operation ; it has the residue in it — there is a small yellow deposit on the evaporation , a some - what tarry or oily - looking substance — I found that this was acid to test paper — supposing a quantity of oil - cover and oilcloth had been burnt in the lower part of the house , to the best of my belief that would account for the deposit I found on the carpet — I tore a piece of paper off the walls and took it home with me , but did not subject it to any special chemical examination — I also found the deposit on the paper ; it was , however , of a different character and appearance at any rate ; it more resembled soot ; it was a very carbonaceous deposit — I examined the glass of the pictures — I removed one of the pictures , and have it here — I observed what appeared to be a yellow oily substance on the glass — I experimented on that by scraping off a portion of the deposit and boiling it with ether , and another portion with water — the etheral solution or evaporation gave me a yellow oily substance very similar to the one obtained from the carpet — the aqueous solution was acid — I may state that both these yellow deposits appeared to resemble as closely as possible the yellow oily substance which is obtained during imperfect burning , the distillation , I ought perhaps rather to say , of wood and such like substances and fabrics ; paper for instance , linen , dresses , and so on — I also examined a white jug , which is hero ; it is completely coated over with a kind of black shining deposit — the deposit on the paper was dull , the deposit on this jug is something intermediate between the two other appearances — on the paper I noticed a black opaque deposit , more like soot — on the glass of the picture I noticed a yellow oily substance not in the I least like soot — this seems to have the blackness of the one and something of the oily character of the other — by burning oilcloth and oil - cover , I taken from the premises , I have produced results essentially identical with these three appearances — a day or two ago I had submitted to me a small portion of the glass from the shop — I have it here ; there is a black opaque tarry - looking deposit on it — I made a small experiment with that within the last few days — I boiled it with ether , and I found that it separated into two portions , a black powder apparently very like soot , and a liquid , which on evaporation gave me a yellow oil identical in appearance with that I obtained by the other processes — that experiment confirms me in the idea of the black shining deposit being somewhat intermediate between the other two — I have here the results of the experiments I made , and , if permitted , can show by burning a small piece of oilcloth the mode in which the deposit is produced — in the first place , I burnt a piece of floor cloth , simply taking two or three thicknesses of it I together — here is a portion of the oil - cover which I myself removed from the premises — I only took three or four thicknesses — I burnt it , and noticed that it burnt with a bright light , and with a very thick , smoky flame — at a short distance above that flame I held this piece of white porcelain , and obtained immediately this deposit on it — there is no particular smell from it , nothing at all in the nature of tar , I believe the burning was too complete for that — I also made another experiment , in which I placed a piece of the substance folded up into a small crucible , such as I have here , in order to take the extreme of the opposite side — in the first experiment I burnt the substance completely with a good supply of air — in this case I did not burn it at all — I simply subjected it to a distillation — I heated it without contact with the air , and in that case I got on the upper portion of the crucible this yellow oily deposit , which is acid to test paper , and resembles closely in all respects the yellow deposit found on the glass of the picture — I should be unable to distinguish between the two — I made a third experiment , not , if I remember right , from the oilcloth , but from the floor cloth ; but in one case I made an experiment from the floor cloth which from an oversight I did not make from the oilcloth — I first got a black soot deposited ; I then exposed it to the oily vapour attainable by the destructive distillation , trying to obtain the appearance I had got on the jug — this is it — of course I produced the effects rather roughly and imperfectly , but that is a shining black appearance , something like that I found on the jug — I believe that was all the experiments I tried — I certainly believe that the appearances I observed on the premises might all have been occasioned by the burning in the shop of a quantity of oilcloth and oil - covering , with a limited draught of air passing through — supposing this table cover to be on the table of a room where the door was shut , and the smoky vapour getting through the crevices and settling on it , I should expect it would present this appearance — I should be sorry 3to swear absolutely that it would , but I should expect it — the tar - like smell on the rug seems to me to resemble very much the burning of wood and other fabrics — I do not say it is identical — a smell is a vague thing to swear to .
obc80	smell	of vapour	suffocating		Supposing a moderate flame , confined to an area of three or four feet , and suddenly a burst of flame , a quantity of black soot , a suffocating smell of vapour , so that persons were obliged to rush out in consequence , should you be of opinion that that arose from the burning of oilcloth ?

A .
obc80	smell	of tar			I did — I saw the remain ! of a quantity of oilcloth that was actually burnt — I have some small piece with me that have been more or less burnt — I saw some in rolls that had been partially burnt , one end of it or something of the sort ; the portion burnt off had been consumed ; I found it in the d é bris ; the great bulk of it appeared to me to have been consumed : I found some remains — it appeared to me that the portion that was not there had been completely consumed ; I could not say that whole rolls had not been consumed — I heard some statement of the time the fire lasted , but I did not pay much attention to it , because it was not the point submitted to me — I think they told me that it had lasted some hour or two , but I did not pay much attention — I am sure that it did not last ten or twelve hours ; looking at the place was enough to show that — a combustion might have been going on for some considerable time before the effects were visible in smoke issuing from the room ; one would fancy that the shop would first of all fill with dense vapour , which would afterward ascend — I cannot say how long the fire would smoulder before smoke would come out — I cannot say that oilcloth burning , and air suddenly admitted , would account for the sudden rush of flame and black smoke ; it might ; it is a question I feel some uncertainty about , not having any special knowledge to guide me — the smell in the nature of tar might be accounted for by the burning of the oilcloth and floor cloth , provided they did burn — it appears to me that might have caused all the appearances I saw — I have no doubt that some quantity was burnt , because I saw it .
obc80	smells|smell|smell	of the oil|of burning oil|of burning tar			I scraped some portions from the wall and from other portions of the premises , and placed them through a rough analysis — the results from the oilcloth do not alter the opinion I have expressed — taking oilcloth and working it in different ways , you can get different results , but the product obtained by the different modes of treating oilcloth differs from the deposit in the house in several particulars — the product obtained by the destructive distillation of the oilcloth is oil , and not tar ; it is a substance that is not siccative and does not dry up into a black pitch ; the substance produced by the distillation of oilcloth smells essentially of the oil ; it is the smell of burning oil , quite distinct from the smell of burning tar — another point is that the distillation is an extremely slow process , whereas the distillation of tar takes place almost instantaneously — it took us three hours to distil one half - pound of the material as we found it ; we took the roll rather thicker than my arm and cut a section out of it , and tried it with the piece of oilcloth as we found it in the premises , and it took us three hours to distil it , and half an hour to burn it on a strong fire , and it left half its weight in ash — I do not mean that it took three hours before a product was obtained that would fasten on the walls and furniture ; the product began to be formed very soon after the heating , but it took that time to effect a complete distillation — there is another point of less character , that the substance produced by the distillation of oilcloth has a very strongly acid reaction , whereas in the case of this deposit on the walls it was only just acid .

obc52	smelling		bad		If I was in the front of the stall and a barrow came up at the back I should see it , because my face was towards the stall — I did not see these cramp bones before Fletcher found them — we had no other bad meat — I never knew this was bad ; I never had the chance of smelling it — I did not see them , because they were lying with some pieces of suet and salt meat — they would not have been sold if they had been discovered ; my master would not sell bad meat , doing the exten - sive business he does — we give hones to boners — I have said """" There was not quite so much flesh as bone """" — 100 costermongers ' barrows pass through Hoxton every Saturday between 9 and 12 , and about four of them sell meat , but I do not know where they get it — I did not see Mr .

obc597	smell	of drink			If a prisoner denies that he is drunk we send for a doctor — the barrow was two yards in front of the leading horse , close to the near side , when I got there — according to the position it was in , I should say that he was pushing it , but I did not see him do so — a man named Hardy was with the driver — I mentioned him to the constable , but he was not charged with anything — I have never said a word against Hardy — I do not know of any cases in which a mistake has been made as to a man being drunk — I have 9 1 / 2 years ' experience as a constable — I do not come into contact with brewer ' s draymen , so I do not know if they smell of drink or not — he did not seem at all nervous — he was quite unconcerned at the station ; he said , """" How much longer are you going to keep me here ?

obc597	smelt	alcohol			I practice at 25 , Bucklersbury — I examined the prisoner on January 7th and 8th — he has middle ear disease , resulting from an injury — it is a common thing that such an injury would affect the semi - circular canals which are connected with the middle ear — the equilibrium of the brain would be upset — he had a droop of the eyelid , and his speech was not clear — on the first day I examined him he was dull and apathetic — the second day he was better — the disease can cause very grave symptoms , it upsets the whole nervous organisation — I have known several cases where people have been affected by the sight of blood — it would be more noticeable in a dull man like the prisoner — under these circumstances the vomiting , heaviness of speech , and sleepiness would be quite consistent with sobriety — in a case of this character a shock would retard the absorption of the stomach ; thus alcohol could be smelt for some time afterwards .

obc208	smelt	nothing|mustard|belladonna liniment			I am surgeon to the E Division of Police — on the morning of 27th February I was called by the last witness to New Inn Passage — I went immediately and found the child in the act of vomiting from the mustard and water which the sergeant had given it ; the vomited matter smelt of nothing but mustard and water — there were no very definite symptoms of any special poison — I was told it had had belladonna liniment given to it , and upon that I sent it to the hospital — the pupils were a little dilated , but nothing more than you ordinarily see in children — dilatation of the pupils is a symptom of belladonna — 1 did not see the child at the hospital , I have seen it once or twice since — this bottle was shown to me by Marriott , it contained about 20 or 30 drops of belladonna liniment ; I did not analyse it — belladonna is calculated to endanger life , it would depend upon the quantity — I have no doubt the child had very little , not sufficient to poison it ; if it had swallowed a poisonous dose there would have been more decided symptoms — the child is only 3 years old — I can ' t say that it would not have developed symptoms of poison had not the emetic been given immediately , but from the subsequent history I cannot think that it had sufficient to poison it — I afterwards went to the station to see the prisoner — he was in a state of great misery , crying , and very tremulous , and nearly on the verge of delirium tremens ; he had been drinking a good deal — he said """" I gave the child this liniment """" — I asked him if he knew it was poison — he said """" Yes , it was belladonna , """" and he assigned as a reason for giving it that the child ' s mother was very ill in the hospital , and that he was out of work and not able to look after the children — he said he was particularly fond of this child , more so than the other ; that he thought the best thing was to put it out of this world ' s misery , and as he had not the heart to strike it he thought it was most merciful to give it this poison , and after he had done it he intended drowning himself in the Thames — I asked him what was to become of the other child — he said that was older and could look after itself — he seemed quite to understand what he was saying — he said he had been drinking for some days and had nothing to eat .

"""" he replied , """" Yes , I have sold it ; """" I then said , """" Where do you get these dogs from ? """" he said , """" I bought some in Club Row , the dog fair , and some I buy at the Dogs ' home """" — I found several vouchers there relating to dogs purchased at the Dogs ' home , but they were all of mongrel breed , none related to valuable dogs — I thought it my duty to obtain a warrant for Jaeger ' s arrest , and it was executed on February 23rd .

obc287	smelt|smelt		very offensively|badly		Ellis — the house was a very nice house outside , but there was hardly any furniture in it , and it smelt very offensively — there were six rooms , including the two kitchens , two room on a floor — the basement story consisted of a front and back kitchen — there was a front and back room on the ground floor , and two bed rooms on the floor above that , and a small ante - room — the basement floor was below the surface of the room ; that was furnished , there was a sofa , and table , and chair — the house smelt badly ; that applied more particularly to the base - ment story , and the bed - rooms — on the ground floor there was hardly a vestige of furniture — when Ellis opened the door , I said """" Does Mrs .

"""" — Waters said she did not know who the parents were — I said """" Are these some more by adoption ? """" — she said """" Yes """" — I then said , in the presence of Ellis , """" Have you any more ?

obc287	smelling|smell	the bottle			THE LORD CHIEF BARON was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible , if the same mode of treat - ment was pursued towards all the children , then the effect of that treatment upon the others became important , in relation to the cause of the death in question ) — My opinion is that there was congestion of the brain in the other four children — I was present at the post - mortem examination , and the congestion of the brain formed a very important part of the cause of death of those four infants — I had noticed the condition of those children whilst living , and they all appeared to have been more or less subjected to the same influence as the infant that was entirely under my charge from the time of its removal , the kind of stupid condition , which led me to believe that narcotic had probably been also administered to them , as I was certain had been in this case — I attribute the cause of their death to a want of suitable food , and probably also to the administration of narcotics — when I went into the front kitchen , with Sergeant Relf , I noticed on the table a small phial , lying with the cork beside it — this is it — I marked it — it contained a few drops of a fluid , which I was of opinion was laudanum — I subsequently examined it more thoroughly , and I am certain it was laudanum — I think it is tincture of opium , which is laudanum — there were only about three drops in the bottle — I don ' t think it was in a diluted state — I think it was as it would be sold as laudanum — after smelling the bottle , and handing it to Relf to smell also , I again asked Waters if she was quite sure she had not given the child anything to make it sleep — she said she had not — cleanliness is very important with a child , whether brought up by hand , or in the ordinary way — this child was not kept well clean , under the arms and behind the ears , and generally it had not been well washed .
obc287	smell	of burning rags			1 , and found the prisoner sitting in a chair , in the garden — I spoke to her ; but she did not answer me — I got over the wall , went into the front kitchen , and found a sofa bedstead on fire , not blazing , only smouldering — I had the gas turned off at the meter — the stuffing of the bed was burning — the gas pipe on the ceiling was melted , and the handles of a tea - pot and coffee - pot were melted , and hanging on the dresser — the fireman came , and I went into the front kitchen , and saw what he saw — on the Tuesday night before this I was called in to the prisoner — she and a little girl were at the door — she said she thought there was something the matter down stairs , and pressed me to go down — I went into the front kitchen , and found it full of smoke — I looked about , but could see no fire — there was no fire in the fireplace — there was a smell of burning rags — I looked about at the boards ; but could find nothing — I went to the next house , made inquiries , and then came back — I went to the cupboard under the stairs , in the basement , and found the ashes of some greasy rags which had been burnt — they were not burning then — I found no fire but the gaslight — that kitchen is three yards from the front kitchen — there is a door to the cupboard , which was closed — the prisoner said she thought somebody had been in the house — I went over the house with her , and asked her if she had lost anything — she said """" No .
obc287	smelt|smell|smell	chloroform|of tobacco|gas|of alcohol|brandy			I am a surgeon , of Agar Terrace , Brixton — on 23rd August , at 8 o ' clock in the morning , I was called to the prosecutor ' s bedroom , and found him lying on his back in a very exhausted state — his feet and hands were cold , he was almost pulseless , and the pupils of his eyes were firmly contracted — on inquiry I found that he had had stertorous breathing during the night — I asked for the vomit , but it had been thrown away — when I took his hand out of bed to feel his pulse I smelt chloroform — I felt his shirt , put it up to my nose , and found chloroform on both sleeves — my judgment is that he had been drugged first with morphia , and after , to destroy sensibility entirely , had chloroform given to him — a small room like a public - house , with the fumes of tobacco or gas in it , would cause morphia to take effect upon him very shortly , as such things deteriorate the Atmosphere — morphia would increase the \ amountof vomit — the utensil did not smell of alcohol , such as gin or brandy ; I should have detected it by the smell if it had been thrown up .
obc287	smell	of his shirt			No , it would increase it — drunken men vomit a good deal , and if there is bile it would be apt to come up with the beer — I ascertained that he had vomited a good deal — that would decrease his pulse — when a man has been very tipsy over night , you do not expect to find his pulse strong in the morning — I did not examine the room , but am certain he had no bottle of chloroform there — the only trace of it I detected was the smell of his shirt — chloroform is highly volatile , but I detected it in the folds of the shirt .

obc326	smell		peculiar		On Monday , the 18th , I was watching the prisoner ' s house in consequence of some communication made to me by King — King is now out of the country — I have looked for him , and cannot find him — about a quarter past 2 o ' clock on the Monday I saw both the prisoners go out — the female prisoner had a glass bottle — I did not see them return — about a quarter past 3 o ' clock I discovered smoke coming from the kitchen , through the area grating into the street — I called the fireman first , and then went into the house , gave the alarm of fire , and ran down stairs followed by Martin and the male prisoner — the door was locked — the prisoner took the key from his pocket and opened it — as soon as it was opened the smoke and flame rushed out so that we were obliged to retreat — the firemen came directly afterwards — I did not notice anything peculiar in the smell — there were persons up stairs at the time — I had noticed the kitchen window from the street — it was whitened over inside so as to present persons seeing through — I do not know when it was whitened — I was on that beat at that time — the window was closed — nothing could have been thrown in from the outside — after the fireman had been in , and to some extent extinguished the fire , I went in — I found the gas pipes down — pulled down from the ceiling — I cannot say whether the gas was escaping — I saw some lines hanging across the kitchen — one ran from the fireplace to the dresser , and another one from the fireplace to the bed — they were partly burnt , and there was some wet linen partly burnt — the dresser was burnt — it was a fixed dresser , fixed against the wall — it was a fixture in the house belonging to the landlord — I do not know that it was let into the wall — I did not notice how it was fixed — there were a few cinders in the fireplace quite cold — after looking over the things I took the prisoner into custody .

obc326	smell		excessively		Burgess ' s premises on previous occasions ; that is used for the manufacture of manure ; mixed with what I believe to be bone powder and coprolite powder , it forms a soluble manure , super phosphate of lime — in March and April , when I visited the premises , I formed the opinion that mixing sulphuric acid and boiling bones would be a nuisance , but I did not see it , and therefore did not certify it as a nuisance — it was in a latent condition — there was no active operation going on — if sulphuric acid was mixed with bone dust it would cause a nuisance , by giving off a suffocating vapour — in consequence of directions I received , I went in May to the defendant ' s premises — they were placed under my inspection by the vestry , in consequence of complaints which had been made — I first went on the 11th ; or 12th , for it was at half past 1 o ' clock in the morning — when I got within 200 yards of the place there was a light vapour coming in a direction from the premises — it was a very fine night , and the atmosphere was very clear — I was in a patent safety cab , and when within 200 yards of the premises the vapour became perceptible — on reaching the premises there was a great noise ; the steam engine was at work , and vapour was all round me , clear and distinct — the gate was closed — on the eastern side there was not much smell , but on the western side ( the wind was coming towards the west ) the vapour came — it produced with me difficulty of breathing and headache , and it was excessively offensive — there was a vapour hanging over the ground for a considerable distance from the premises ; I saw it from the arches of the railway , and on the other side of the railway , the south side , the atmosphere was perfectly clear — there was a great steam arising from a ditch , which I imagine to have been caused by the waste water of the steam engine — the vapour was almost entirely on the western side — it appeared to come from the erection close to the railway — operations were going on there — I experienced a peculiar metallic taste in my mouth ; I believe that to have arisen from the use of sulphuric acid ; that would produce headache — the vapour gradually dispersed during the half hour I was there , and in dispersing , it became more diffused and less dense — I did not at that time smell anything that I think arose from gas finings — in my opinion the smell I smelt at that time would be injurious to health — it was not a pleasant smell — you could not enjoy life in that vapour — the ditch round Mr .

obc326	smell		different		Burgess was very civil to me — I was on the premises about an hour on 4th June ; the smell was different on that day to what it had been before , and I can swear that it was a different process — I do not think it was acid that was being used — I made this report ( handing it in ) the vapour on 12th May rolled over the market gardens , and no doubt contaminated the atmosphere — I noticed on one occasion that the leaves of the fruit trees in the neighbourhood were shrivelled and scorched , and brown at the edges , whilst at some distance from the premises they are in a healthy condition — I attribute the difference to the vapour on Mr .

obc326	deodorizing|smell|smell	skins			Sheppard — I had expressed my readiness to go there at any time , as they complained that I had not been active — I believe there has been a dispute about a right of way — the varnish manufactures would poison plants , supposing the vapour to go that way ; they have each an appliance to consume the vapour in the shaft , but I do not think it is quite effectual ; in fact I do not think they like to use it , they are afraid of explosion — there are a great number of tanneries in Bermondsey — as you approach these premises there seems to be a legion of them ; in some of them they use what is called """" pure ; """" that is , a solution of dog ' s excrement — it is used in pits , the nuisance arising from that is simply when the solution is let off into the sewers , but that has now been remedied by the use of deodorizing powder , and by the free use of water ; it is not used so much for the heavy as the lighter skins , such as are used for ladies ' gloves — some have endeavoured to get rid of the nuisance , nevertheless the air is impregnated wherever the deodorizing process is not used — besides that , the soaking of putrid skins would produce a smell , but lime is used — the smell from the fellmongers ' yard would not be agreeable — in spite of all this , it is one of the healthiest spots in the metropolis ; we have less consumption in Bermondsey than in any district in London , the open ground near the railway is the best spot for a Consumption Hospital — my printed report merely speaks of the great prolificness of the neighbourhood — Mr .
