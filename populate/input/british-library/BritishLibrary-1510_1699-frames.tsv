And now that the Equity and just Reason is so Perspicuous , why in Ecclesiasiick Ecclesiasiick Censure the Assistance should be added of such , as whom not the vile Odour of Gain and Fees ( forbid it God and blow it with a Whirlwind out of our Land ) but Charity , Neighbourhood , and Duty to Church - government Church - government hath call ' d together , where could a wise Man wish a moreeejual gratuitous gratuitous and meek Examination of any Offence that he might happen to commit commit against Christianity then here ? Would he prefer those Proud Simoniacal Courts ? Thus therefore the Minister assisted attends his heavenly and spiritual spiritual Cure .	Where we ssiall see him both in the Course of his Proceeding , and sirst in the Excellence of his End from the Magistrate far Different , and not more Different then Excelling .

The Remonstrant having to do with grave and reverend Men his Adversaries , thought it became him to tell them in scorn , that the Bistops Foot had been in their Book and Confuted it , which when I saw him arrogate , to have done that with his Heels that surpast the best Consideration of his Head , to spurn a Confutation Confutation among respected Men , I question ' d not the Lawfulness of moving his Jollity to bethink him , what Odor a Sock would have in such a painful painful Business .

And this may have chane ' d to touch him more nearly then I was aware ; for indeed a Bissiops Foot that hath all his Toes , maugre the Gou ^ and a Linen Sock over it , is the aptest Emblem of the Prelate himself Who being a Pluralist may under one Surplice , which is also Linnen , hide sour Benefices Benefices besides the Metropolitan Toe , and lends a fouler stench to Heaven then that which this young Qucasiness reaches at .	And this is the immediate Reason here , why our inrag ' d Confuter , that he may be as perfect an Hypoerit Hypoerit as Caiaphas , ' ere he be a High Priest , cries out , hor id Blasphemy !

I beseech ye Friends , ' ere the Brick - bats flye , resolve me and your selves , is it Blasphemy , or any what disagreeing from Christian Meekness , when as Christ himself speaking of unsavory Traditions , Traditions , scruples not to name the Dunghil and the Jakes , for me to answer a slovenly Wincer of a Confutation , that , if he would needs put his Foot to such a sweaty Service , the Odour of his Sock was like to be neither Musk , nor Benjamin ? Thus did that soolissi Monk in a barbarous Declamation accuse accuse Petrarch of Blasphemy for dispraising the French Wines .	But this which follows is plain Bedlam Stuff , this is the Demoniack Legion indeed , which the Remonstrant fear ' d had been against him , and now he may see is for him .

bl1662	fragrant|fragrant	Spring	delicious|fragrant|fragrant								319 piness will it be to us , when tempting Rewards are taken away , that the cunningest and most dangerous Mercenaries will cease of themselves to frequent frequent the Fold , whom otherwise scarce all the Prayers of the Faithful could have kept back from devouring the Flock ? But a ttue Pastor of Christ ' s sending sending hath this especial Mark , that for greatest Labours , and greatest Merits in the Church , he requires either nothing , if he could so subsist , or a very common and reasonable Supply of human Necessaries : We cannot therefore do better then to leave this Care of ours to God , he can easily send Labourers Labourers into his Harvest , that ssiall not cry , give , give , but be contented with a moderate and beseeming Allowance ; nor will he suffer true Learning to be wanting , where true Grace and Obedience to him abounds : For if he give us to know him aright , and to practice this our Knowledge in right estabiissit Disciplin , how much more will he replenissi us with all Abilities in Tongues and Arts , that may conduce to his Glory and our Good & gt ; He can stir up rich Fathers to bestow exquisite Education upon their Children and so dedicate dedicate them to the Service of the Gospel ; he can make the Sons of Nobles his Ministers and Princes to be his Nazarites ; for certainly there is no Imployment Imployment more Honourable , more Worthy to take up a great Spirit , more requiring a generous and free Natute , then to be the Messenger and Herald of heavenly Truth from God to Man , and by the faithful Workosholy Doctrin , to procreate a Number of faithful Men , making a kind of Creation like to Gods , by infusing his Spirit and Likeness into them , to their Salvation .	as God did into him , arising to what climat soever he turn him , like thatSon of Righteousness that sent him , with healing in his Wings and new Light to break in upon the chill and gloomy Hearts of his Hearers , raising out of darksom Barreness a delicious and fragrant Spring of saving Knowledge and good Works .	Can a Man thus imploy ' d , find himself discontented , or dishonours for want of Ad - mittance to have a pragmatical Voice at Sessions and Jay 1 Deliveries ? Or because he may not as a Judge sit out the wrangling Noise of litigious Courts , to ssireeve the Purses of unconscssing and unmortify ' d Sinners and not their Souls , or be discourag ' d though Men call him not Lord , whenas the due Performance of his Office would gain him even from Lords and Princes , the voluntary Title of Father ? Would he tug for a Barony to sit and vote in Parliament , knowing that no Man can take from him the Gift of Wisdom and sound Doctrin which leaves him free , though not to be a Member , yet a Teacher and Perswader of the Parliament ? And in all wise Apprehensions the perswasive Power in Man to win others to Goodness by Instruction is grea - ter and more Divine then the compulsive Power to restrain Men from being Evil by Terrour of the Law ; and therefore Christ left Moses to be the Law - giver , but himself came down amongst us to bea Teacher , with which Office his Heavenly Wisdom was so well pleas ' d , as that he was angry with those that would have put aPiece of Temporal Judicature into his Hand , disclaim - ing that he had any Commission from above for such Marters .

But to dwell no longer in Characterizing the Depravities of the Church , and how they sprung , and how they took Increase ; when I recal to mind at last , after so many dark Ages , wherein the huge overssiadowing Train of Error Error had almost swept all the Stars out ofthe Firmament of the Church ; how the bright and blissful Reformation ( by Divine Power ) strook through the black and settled Night of Ignorance and Antichristian Tyranny , me thinks a Soveraign and reviving Joy must needs russi into the bosome of him that reads or hears ; and the sweet Odour of the returning Gospel imbath his Soul with the Fragrancy of Heaven .
