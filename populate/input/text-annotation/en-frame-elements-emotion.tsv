33-44	fetid	bronchitis			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	I suspect, however, that these caseswere examples of pyogenic cavities, or dilated bronchi, and notgangrene ; for it is probable these pyogenic membranes give forththe same purulent stuff as the bronchial mucous membrane in casesof fetid bronchitis.
34-12	smells	the expectoration					like fasces		in phthisis		sometimes					018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Dr EUiotson remarks incidentally, that inphthisis the expectoration sometimes smells   like fasces. 
35-24	odour			I	faecal				in any such cases							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	I mustexpress a doubt, however, that these were cases of tubercularphthisis, for I have never observed the faecal odour in any suchcases.
36-2	fetid	pus			fetid | not uncommon											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Although fetid pus is not uncommon, pulmonary fetor,sui generis, is by no means a common symptom.
36-9	fetor				pulmonary											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Although fetid pus is not uncommon, pulmonary fetor,sui generis, is by no means a common symptom.
38-16	fetor	of gangrene | of ozaena | of faces			pulmonary											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	It follows, from these facts, that there are three distinct kinds ofpulmonary fetor, namely, that of faces, that of ozaena, and that ofgangrene ; and it remains to ascertain how each arises.
39-2	odour	of pulmonary gangrene							is obviously due to putrescent decomposition of the dead pulmonary tissue							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The odour of pulmonary gangrene is obviously due to putrescentdecomposition of the dead pulmonary tissue; it is the odour ofputrefaction.
39-21	odour	of putrefaction														018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The odour of pulmonary gangrene is obviously due to putrescentdecomposition of the dead pulmonary tissue; it is the odour ofputrefaction.
49-29	fetor	the gangrenous cavity							has no contact with the external air							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The bacterides may, however, be a causeof those kinds in wliich the gangrenous cavity has no contact withthe external air and there is no fetor, inasmuch as they are abundantly present in the blood in carbuncular gangrene, and whichsometimes affects the lungs.
50-9	ozena-odour	ozena-odour		Laennec					of bronchorrhoea | bronchitis | attributed by several observers to a putrescence of the bronchial excretions							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Since Laennec first mooted the opinion, the ozena-odour incertain forms of bronchorrhoea and bronchitis has been attributedby several observers to a putrescence of the bronchial excretions.
52-4	odour	of the fetid pus							expectorated in cases of empyema							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Besides,the odour evolved is not at all like that of the fetid pus expectorated in cases of empyema, in which the cavity communicates with abronchus, so that if the purulent bronchial excretion do undergochange, there must be something in its composition in these casesof a special character.
54-25	odour						is not like the smell of decomposing pus from ordinary ulcers									018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Inozaena from ulceration of the nasal cartilages, and in rodent fibroidulcers, there is a most offensive discharge, but the odour is not likethe smell of decomposing pus from ordinary ulcers.
54-30	smell	of decomposing pus							from ordinary ulcers							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Inozaena from ulceration of the nasal cartilages, and in rodent fibroidulcers, there is a most offensive discharge, but the odour is not likethe smell of decomposing pus from ordinary ulcers.
55-9	fetid	bronchitis			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The pus offibroid pyogenic cavities and of fetid bronchitis undergoes a similarchange.
58-12	fetid	pulmonary diseases			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	In so faras anatomical changes have been observed in these fetid pulmonarydiseases, they are manifestly those of fibrinous exudation anddegeneration, — are, in short, those which are observed in acute andchronic tissue-changes of rheumatic origin.
66-38	fetor				pulmonary				in all cases							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	That a rheumatic condition is an important element in these casesis shown by collateral evidence, although the morbid product neednot necessarily be lactic acid, and certainly is not in all cases ofpulmonary fetor.
68-19	fetid	bronchopneumonia			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Now these cases of   plastic bronchitis  run a course almost identical with that of cases of fetid bronchopneumonia.
73-20	fetid	special kind of lobar bronchopneumonia			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	These cases ofplastic bronchitis shade off also into that special kind of lobar bronchopneumonia, closely resembling the fetid kind in symptoms andcourse, and occurring in rheumatic subjects, to wliicli I liave alreadyreferred.
75-10	stronglysmelling	sweats			stronglysmelling											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The patient (a man) has had profuse stronglysmelling sweats, like those of the. rheumatic, and rheumaticcorpuscles in his urine.
76-1	Fetor	of the breath							closely resembling that under consideration is observed in pregnancy , scorbutus , and cachectic states of a rheumatic character							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Fetor of the breath closely resembling that under considerationis observed in pregnancy, scorbutus, and cachectic states of a rheumatic character ; in all these the blood is highly fibrinous andembolism not uncommon.
79-19	fetor								the excess of fibrin							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	But, howevercaused, the excess of fibrin is probably a predisposing or excitingcause of the fetor.
80-9	fetor				pulmonary											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	These remarks refer chiefly to cases of pulmonary fetor in whichchanges of structure have been observed.
81-19	odour				very characteristic | faecal											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	But in one class ofthese affections there is no cognisable disease, and yet a verycharacteristic odour (the faecal) is exhaled.

84-19	stench	of fetid bronchitis							has been attributed to gangrene							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	It has been roundly asserted that this is due simplyto want of cleanliness, just as the stench of fetid bronchitis hasbeen attributed to gangrene ; but the theory is certainly not sound.
85-13	smell															018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Cases occur in which the most scrupulous cleanliness fails to preventthe smell.
86-26	scents				powerful											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Indeed, I know no more intractable malady, for even whenthe stockings and shoes are changed two or three times a-day andpowerful scents used, the morbid stench is still diffused.

91-7	odour											offensive | offensive	Disgust | Disgust	Negative | Negative	 | 	018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Allied to this is the offensive odour in someforms of rheumatic fever and in cases of acute recuiTcnt attacksof leprous inflammation of the skin, in which the paroxysm terminates by a copious plastic exudation into the cutaneous cellular tissue.
92-5	fetid	The urine			fetid						sometimes					018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The urine sometimes becomes fetid in like manner.
94-19	stench	the volatile matter														018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Speculations have naturally arisen as to the immediate originand composition of the volatile matter which causes the stench;and as the blood is easily impregnated with volatile stuff, it isreadily concluded that it comes from the blood.
94-27	impregnated	the blood														018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Speculations have naturally arisen as to the immediate originand composition of the volatile matter which causes the stench;and as the blood is easily impregnated with volatile stuff, it isreadily concluded that it comes from the blood.
95-52	fetid	perspiration			fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Perhaps it maybe so as to some ; but I think it equally probable as to others,that they first become what we find them on exposure to the air inthe lungs at a blood-heat, or on the surface of the body, as in casesof fetid perspiration.
96-4	smell								The change							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	The change in smell which the fetid sputaundergo on exposure to the air shows how easily decompositiontakes place.

97-4	odour	an excretion			faecal											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Possibly the faecal odour may be an excretion, but ifit were so in my first observed case, it did not originate in anyso-called metastasis, for I noted the state of the faeces as to odourand observed no change.
97-40	odour	the faeces		I												018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Possibly the faecal odour may be an excretion, but ifit were so in my first observed case, it did not originate in anyso-called metastasis, for I noted the state of the faeces as to odourand observed no change.
98-16	smell	Pus from abscesses			highly faecal					in the abdominal parietes						018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	Pus from abscesses in the abdominalparietes has been found to be highly faecal in smell, although themost careful examination failed to detect any connexion betweenthe abscess and the intestines.
99-17	fetid	sulphur		I	fetid											018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.tsv	femke.tsv	I have no doubt that sulphur isa predominant, albeit not exclusive constituent of these fetid volatile changes.
