fetid	excretion			fetid | peculiar							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Sincethe structural disease is constitutional, it is fair to conclude thatthe predisposing causes of the peculiar fetid excretion are constitutional, and are linked etiologically with the fibroid change oftissue.

fetid	pulmonary diseases			fetid							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	In so faras anatomical changes have been observed in these fetid pulmonarydiseases, they are manifestly those of fibrinous exudation anddegeneration, — are, in short, those which are observed in acute andchronic tissue-changes of rheumatic origin.
fetor				pulmonary				in all cases			018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	That a rheumatic condition is an important element in these casesis shown by collateral evidence, although the morbid product neednot necessarily be lactic acid, and certainly is not in all cases ofpulmonary fetor.
fetid	bronchopneumonia			fetid							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Now these cases of " plastic bronchitis "run a course almost identical with that of cases of fetid bronchopneumonia.
fetid	special kind of lobar bronchopneumonia			fetid							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	These cases ofplastic bronchitis shade off also into that special kind of lobar bronchopneumonia, closely resembling the fetid kind in symptoms andcourse, and occurring in rheumatic subjects, to wliicli I liave alreadyreferred.

Fetor	of the breath							closely resembling that under consideration is observed in pregnancy , scorbutus , and cachectic states of a rheumatic character			018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Fetor of the breath closely resembling that under considerationis observed in pregnancy, scorbutus, and cachectic states of a rheumatic character ; in all these the blood is highly fibrinous andembolism not uncommon.
fetor								the excess of fibrin			018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	But, howevercaused, the excess of fibrin is probably a predisposing or excitingcause of the fetor.
fetor				pulmonary							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	These remarks refer chiefly to cases of pulmonary fetor in whichchanges of structure have been observed.
odour				very characteristic | faecal							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	But in one class ofthese affections there is no cognisable disease, and yet a verycharacteristic odour (the faecal) is exhaled.
stench	perspiration of the feet			offensive		a peculiar cabbage-like stench					018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	In offensive perspiration of the feet a peculiar cabbage-like stenchis given off.
stench	of fetid bronchitis							has been attributed to gangrene			018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	It has been roundly asserted that this is due simplyto want of cleanliness, just as the stench of fetid bronchitis hasbeen attributed to gangrene ; but the theory is certainly not sound.

odour				offensive							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Allied to this is the offensive odour in someforms of rheumatic fever and in cases of acute recuiTcnt attacksof leprous inflammation of the skin, in which the paroxysm terminates by a copious plastic exudation into the cutaneous cellular tissue.

fetid	perspiration			fetid							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Perhaps it maybe so as to some ; but I think it equally probable as to others,that they first become what we find them on exposure to the air inthe lungs at a blood-heat, or on the surface of the body, as in casesof fetid perspiration.
smell								The change			018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	The change in smell which the fetid sputaundergo on exposure to the air shows how easily decompositiontakes place.

smell	Pus from abscesses			highly faecal					in the abdominal parietes		018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	Pus from abscesses in the abdominalparietes has been found to be highly faecal in smell, although themost careful examination failed to detect any connexion betweenthe abscess and the intestines.
fetid	sulphur		I	fetid							018E Thomas Laycock 1865 Notes on Fetid Bronchitis__285_distribution.txt	teresa.tsv	I have no doubt that sulphur isa predominant, albeit not exclusive constituent of these fetid volatile changes.
